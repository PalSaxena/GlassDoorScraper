The company has done a great job of hiring people who are genuine, smart, hard-working, and passionate about the mission. You really get the sense that leadership cares about you & your wellbeing. I've felt very supported from a career development and mentorship perspective as well. Some highlights of working here: - Amazing work-life balance - Kind & fun coworkers - Work-from-anywhere policy (+ nice offices in SF & Chicago for those who want to be hybrid) - Benefits are solid! Great health insurance options, 5 month parental leave, plus some fertility & therapy-related benefits - People are largely bought into the vision I think it's a great place to build your career as a PM!",- Compensation could be better (compared to big tech) - Would be nice to have a larger 401k match - Many tech companies offer a paid sabbatical for those who have been at the company for 3+ years. Would be nice if Glassdoor offered something similar!

empReview_65539051,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW65539051.htm,Built A Long & Successful Career Here,5.0," Vice President, Corporate Communicationsin San Francisco, CA","Jun 14, 2022","If you're looking for a company that cares about you (as an employee and as a person), I have never experienced anything better than Glassdoor and I've been working for 20 years now (yes, getting up there!). 

As an employee, I started at Glassdoor over a decade ago as a PR specialist and am wrapping up my final week as a Vice President. I'm pretty darn proud of this and have also worked my butt off to achieve this. I point this out because my Glassdoor experience is one of career growth and career opportunities, and I continue to see this hold true across Glassdoor. If you want to try new things, you can do so. If you want to get promoted, take on more and expand your skillset, you can do all of this at Glassdoor. It's encouraged, it's welcome and it's there for you. However, and this is where some people don't quite understand 'the how' in this, it's really up to... you. It's yours for the taking, but as someone who has lived it and done it, it is possible and this is one of the best things about Glassdoor. Yes, it often means raising your hand, asking to take on something new while still juggling a ton of other things, but if you can prove you can do it, you can be rewarded, at least I have and I've seen it with others too. This is really exciting as you can build your own career and given that Glassdoor is experiencing some great ongoing success right now, it continues to be an awesome shop to grow your career, transform and learn. For me, I've also always felt like my work has been interesting, that I've impacted peoples' lives in and out of Glassdoor and that I've been compensated fairly along the way too. 

As a person, I've also always felt like Glassdoor has supported me in and out of work. I've brought my full self to work since day 1 and never had to pretend I was back in the closet or that I wasn't able to show or say I'm a part of the LGBTQ+ community. Glassdoor, its leaders and employees have always been very supportive and I love how welcoming Glassdoor is, it just makes it even more fun to be your self and know that it's more than OK to just be... you. In fact, it has probably helped me in my career too because it allows truth, authenticity and transparency to come through in all you do very naturally.

While this has been the best place I've ever worked, I'm leaving to go to our sister company, Indeed, because an awesome opp has presented itself that fits my personal and professional interests a lot at this point in my career. I point this out because even more career opps exist in the Recruit Holdings family (parent company of Glassdoor and Indeed) than you may first realize - some of us are finding new opps at Indeed, our sister company, while some Indeedians are finding new career opps at Glassdoor too. 

Finally, and this is a trend many others say in their reviews too - one of the best parts about Glassdoor is by far the people - just good people who want the best for you, are helpful, are transparent with you, and there to catch you no matter what. I've learned so much from those around me and will bring this forward always in what I do at work and beyond. 

Thank you, Glassdoor, for everything! I'm just 'across the street' and hope others have a similar experience that I did. It's there if you want it. Glassdoor is, by far, one of the Best Places to Work.","While I've had an amazing experience at Glassdoor, and every company has room for improvement, here are some of the things where I'd want to see Glassdoor improve going forward (and I do believe leaders are aware of this already btw) -

Product innovation and speed of product development - Glassdoor has an amazing product and has many new features in the works now. They are so so darn cool that we just want them out to market ASAP vs 6 months from now or a year from now. Keep investing in our awesome product team and get them out to market! The world needs them, like now. (Keep in mind, I'm also an impatient comms/PR pro and we always want speedy product innovation to tout).

Compared to other companies, Glassdoor imo has done a great job innovating and making strides in its DEI efforts. It not just talks the talk, but walks the walk, publishing what it is committed to, how it's progressing towards its goals, and continuing to implement new programs and strategies to support a more inclusive and equitable work environment. Sure, there is still much work to be done, but don't lose sight of this, Glassdoor! Feels like some companies around the country are losing sight of this significance, and Glassdoor can continue to lead here. Keep up the great work and marching towards those goals and commitments! Don't slow down on this."

If you're starting off in your career this is a great place to learn. Although misguided and out of touch at times, their DEI efforts are respectable and they're trying, which was great to see.","Leadership only pretends to be transparent and supportive, favoritism, lots of turnover, poor communication between departments makes your work harder than it has to be, babysitting and making sure other people do their job right, passive-aggressive/fake culture at times. Some sales leadership recently left without any opportunities lined up so that was alarming to see. Not a lot of room for growth, promotions are usually one level at a time so be prepared to wait. Unless you're a favorite- then you might get promoted within a year, maybe even 2 or 3 times."

empReview_63389814,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW63389814.htm,A model for other companies to follow,5.0, Anonymous Employee,"Apr 28, 2022","Glassdoor walks the talk, period. For the first time in my life I can envision myself HAPPILY working for this company until I retire. Everyone I've met and dealt with has been a breath of fresh air. Smart, professional, creative, up on the latest trends, forward-thinking and dedicated to a positive culture for all employees. The interview experience was one of the best I've had (with minor exceptions noted below), starting out with complete salary transparency, being up-front about the benefits package, and offering quality interviews that gave great insight on my department and the company's goals.

I am happy in my work, and because of the multifaceted approach to a positive, supportive culture, I feel taken care of and valued for my contributions and encouraged to achieve work/life balance. Honestly, it's astounding - I've never felt this way before about working anywhere, and I have had a LOT of jobs.

I am particularly impressed with the CEO, and I don't impress easily when it comes to the C-suite. He's incredibly sharp, deeply genuine, passionate about his work and energetically and authentically driven to keep the company moving forward.

The employee resource groups and Slack channels are an outstanding way to encourage and support different specialized groups of employees.","The interview process is lengthier and more complicated than it needs to be in an environment where talent is impatient and have their pick of jobs. I had to meet with five different people to get the job, and several of them are not even people I work with. I understand careful vetting, but would empower department heads to make decisions earlier in the hiring process without having to involve so many different levels of interview. While this isn't my record for interviews (I had 7 interviews at one company), it's 2nd place."
empReview_66533775,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW66533775.htm,After three years at Glassdoor,2.0, Systems Engineer,"Jul 11, 2022",It was a worthwhile place to work the first two years I was there.,"n.b. In keeping with Glassdoor's Community Guidelines, I will not use proper names or specific titles to identify individuals

I worked for Glassdoor for just over three years. During my first two years, even with all the upheaval the pandemic brought, I enjoyed working for the company. My first two years at Glassdoor lived up to the company's mission of helping people find a job they love at a place they love. 

I left the company for three reasons: 
• IT Upper management, specifically director and above
• Uncertainty about Glassdoor remaining an independent entity 
• Workload

The last issue, workload, was one that was an issue almost my entire time at Glassdoor. Yes, it was tasking to be expected to keep up a demanding pace of project after project with no time set aside for foundation building or even just to catch your breath. Yes, I believed during my entire time with the company that IT was never fully staffed, especially for the numerous things we were expected to accomplish. But these are not uncommon in IT, and I largely made a peace with it over time. If workload was the only fault of working for Glassdoor I would not have left. This was a contributing factor though, and one that became more grating over time because of the next two reasons.

Glassdoor and Indeed are sister companies, both of which are owned by Recruit Holdings. Since the summer of 2020, whole functions and the staff who do them have been moved over to Indeed from Glassdoor by Recruit. When broaching the subject with management, we were told, “No, Glassdoor is not merging with Indeed” but it is hard not to look at the consolidation and not think it could happen to you someday; it was a looming threat. As this consolidation only began happening after Glassdoor cut a third of it's workforce in Spring of 2020, it was hard to be at ease with the state of the company.

The primary reason I left Glassdoor was I no longer could work for IT upper management. I worked under the current upper management team for five to 12 months, depending on when each individual started with Glassdoor. After working for their department for this period of time, I concluded that I could not continue to work for an IT organization they were responsible for managing. They are the bosses and get to make the decisions, but I could opt to leave and I did.

During my first two years with Glassdoor, I worked under a different management team comprised of an IT Director (who was “detailed” to Indeed for a special project and had not yet returned to Glassdoor by time I had left) and CIO (who was moved over to Indeed in 2021 and never came back, even though they spent a year pretending like he was still involved with Glassdoor) who often, I felt, managed by various forms of chaos. Yes, it could be frustrating at times, but it was workable. With these two individuals, I felt they would at least listen to my or my team's arguments and we could come to an agreement eventually. The team, IT Engineering, would eventually be allowed to do the work in the way we felt best as long as we accomplished the same end goal. 

With the newer IT upper management, there was seemingly no trust in the staff. Current IT upper management would repeatedly second guess efforts — not just on the larger roadmap things you would expect management to be involved with — but down to specific operational details like date and times announcements would go out or shifting around launch dates at the last minute. Communication within the department was fractured by their actions. They simultaneously balked at participating in regular IT day-to-day discussions and practices and attempted to control and maintain discipline over any communication happening within and coming out of IT. This could be taken as just a difference in personalities, but I felt it did a lot of damage to the feeling of “unit cohesion” IT staff and IT management had previously had. 

Current IT upper management compounded matters with their constant refrain of “we can outsource that”. AV, networking, systems administration — there was not a function of IT that they seemingly felt they could not ship out. Rather than hiring into the company, building on and fostering the team, they wanted to take functionality away. Of the few projects we tried outsourcing with, the IT Engineering team likely ended up spending more time on administration and cleanup than if we had just performed the work ourselves. Hiring specialists has it's place and can be useful, but this was something different. It also contributed to the belief they did not have trust in the staff. 

More so than the communication breakdown or the impression the team was being undermined by lack of support, I was most shocked by how they treated my team's manager. Brought in to be the Senior IT Manager, overseeing both IT Support (aka Help Desk) and IT Engineering, she started just a few weeks before current IT upper management but fit in so well it was like she had been there for years. 

Our manager exhibited Glassdoor's values of grit, transparency and just being a good person. She listened to her team and really considered our feedback. When needed, she told us to stop arguing and just get things done as asked. As a team, we never felt like she was telling us one thing and then turning around and telling someone else in the company something else. The Senior IT Manager was a real mensch. 

For whatever their reasons, current IT upper management actively worked to make life within Glassdoor uncomfortable for the Senior IT Manager. Everyone on the team detected the palpable dislike they had for the Senior IT Manager. It would show up in interactions during in-person meetings or offhand comments in email or Zoom calls. I personally had never seen upper level executives treat someone below them in the organization in such a petty manner. I felt it was unfair to the Senior IT Manager. I also could not escape the feeling that if they could do it to her, someone in management, what would stop them from doing it to the rest of us further down the line? If you spoke up or questioned them, why couldn't you be the next target? The IT Engineering team brought up all these matters and others with HR as part of our 360 review of current IT upper management in February. There was no meaningful response from the company or current IT upper management. 

I never felt unappreciated for the work I did at Glassdoor. I was well compensated and received bonuses, and I even received a SMASHIE, Glassdoor's equivalent of “one of the employees of the year” award, in 2021. The team I worked with was nothing but the best. I opted to leave because I did not want to work for this upper management team at a company with such an unset future."

A Tough Day, Indeed.",2.0," Anonymous Employeein Chicago, IL","May 11, 2020","I learned more and achieved more in my time at Glassdoor than I did anywhere else I have worked. Amazingly, one of the worst things about Glassdoor made me a stronger sales professional than I ever thought I could become. I suppose I can address those things in the cons section - so there’s your stay tuned. 

Selling Glassdoor is one of the hardest sales I have experienced. I genuinely believe that if you can sell Glassdoor, you can sell almost anything. That belief will serve me and my 300 laid off colleagues very well in their search for their next play. 

I will be forever thankful for the amazing friends I made at this company when it still existed as the Glassdoor we knew. Even though that company absolutely died stone dead on May 7th, it felt like a special place. The people on the floor are what made it special. 

We carried this place on our backs. Invested years of emotional labor in ourselves, our teammates, and our direct reports. We cared more than anyone should have about a company that sells pictures and videos to people for 1000s of dollars. 

The number of truly talented and wonderful human beings that I worked with and are now unemployed is staggering. I cannot express just how badly Glassdoor messed up by letting these people go.","The reason I was able to achieve even one thing at Glassdoor, is because there is no standardized sales process nor a true enablement team. A sales rep has to hope for a leader who knows how to sell, and that rep had better be a curious person who wants to learn and be willing to lean on your peers. 

Glassdoor is such a difficult sale with prospects usually upset about ratings, calling it a “rant site”, saying people don’t look at jobs on Glassdoor, claiming users just want to see negative reviews. Those preconceived notions were very hard to sell against. 

Thankfully, with the help of my great colleagues, I was able to develop my own sales process that helped me overperform and begin seeing success. 

Eventually, mastering that process and building great internal relationships allowed me to get into leadership where I truly got to see the stunning level of incompetence and miscommunication up close. 

I’ll try and go department by department.

I would post a gif of a tumbleweed for sales enablement if that was allowed. We were each other's sales enablement team. Ironically, not having a true sales process - one where someone can ask “What is the Glassdoor sales process?” and get a very quick, short, concise answer - is what forced me to fend for myself and learn to sell. Enablement was really good at delegating what should have been their responsibilities to the reps and managers. They were also great at being able to string together what few sales events we did have because there was very little budget pretty much constantly. 

Why didn’t Glassdoor commit to building a world class sales enablement team and roll out a standardized sales process for reps and managers to follow? I’ll never know. But they’re still employed so they must be doing something right. 

The product itself barely changed in four years. Eventually prospects will stop falling for “we have more traffic this year” when they ask what’s changed since the last time we tried to sell them Glassdoor. Once every year, the product team would tell us about very small changes they were planning to roll out at some point within the next five years. I can’t wait to see the color of the button in 2027. 

I’m not sure where to start with Sales Development. The name of the org is Sales Development. Develop sales reps. Nurture them. Don’t bully them into low paying jobs that are somehow even harder and more work than hunter and growth roles.

The SDR org was a total mess that rewarded good SDRs by “promoting” the most promising inbound reps into a tier where high Enterprise reps belittled them, refused to flip their meetings, and blamed them for any shortcomings that they refused to do anything about themselves. 

The amount of amazing AEs that came through that org did so through their own sheer will and talent, and frankly not knowing their own value - because these reps could have been making 2x the pay at literally any other sales company. 

Sales ops is rough at almost every company but I cannot fathom a more inept ops team than the one we had at Glassdoor. Their hallmark was consistently building out nonsensical books, bizarre quotas, and never, ever, ever doing any data refreshing. Here’s an idea - consult the actual front line reps before building out plans that 70% of the reps are going to miss. They finally managed to bring in one very awesome person, who we all loved, and I hope she still has a job. I can’t say her name but anyone reading this knows who I’m talking about. Wingman of the Year and well deserved. 

Senior Leadership, I just wish I could understand what value you bring. It honestly feels extremely silly that all of the conversations about promotion paths, job families, and arguing attainment vs. competence were something that occupied so much of our time and energy - and they just took it away from us with a snap of their fingers. When I say senior leadership, I mean sales senior leadership. And I mean VP level and up. I could not have asked for a better director who cared more about our people - but above the director was miscommunication, non-communication, false promises, and patchwork solutions. You and ops combined to set us up for failure. A fiscal year where less than 30% of reps and managers were able to hit quarters. The rep participation rates quarter over quarter were shameful. 

Was it the business or the product? It damn sure wasn’t the people - the managers and reps worked tirelessly to try and bring success to an organization that consistently underpaid and undervalued the talent they had. And now we’re all gone. What a shame. 

The CEO. Where to begin. When I started at Glassdoor we had Robert. And while Robert wasn’t the business person some CEOs are, Robert was a human being. He spoke his mind. He spoke with conviction. He was entertaining. I found myself wanting to work for him. That’s the very least a CEO can be. When he spoke, everyone listened. At sales kickoff, he was a highlight every year. He even came out to get drinks with the sales team despite his insistence that “sales people are the absolute worst.” Robert, cheers man. I hope you’re enjoying time with League of Legends - but when the decision was made to sell to Recruit, it seems like the writing was on the wall. 

Enter Christian Sutherland-Wong. When he wasn’t talking about his mum in literally every single all hands address, he was hiding. I don’t know where - maybe hanging out with Indeed executives. He showed up to the Chicago office maybe 2 or 3 times total in his entire tenure as CEO of what used to be Glassdoor. He showed zero ability to command an audience, bragged to us about inventing LinkedIn’s corporate culture when he was there, and did not remotely understand what we do on a daily basis. It’s no surprise he was able to make the call to fire all of us so quickly.

I remember (maybe 3-4 months ago) when he came to Chicago to speak to our sales team as we trained our reps how to effectively reach out to CEOs at companies in our books. He stumbled his way through a couple sentences of complete gibberish before exiting the room to a bunch of confused faces. He then came back and read off some words that seemed like they were straight off a marketing slide. He was always saying “people need us now more than ever” as he was putting GD on a hiring freeze of its own and eventually, swiftly, and without warning liquidating the jobs of 300 talented, wonderful people. 

Not more than a month ago, Christian told us that this was the beginning of our journey of becoming the best tool in the world for job seekers. Either he didn’t know that this was coming, while COVID was already in full swing mind you, or he’s just a liar. Either way the lack of transparency at a company that stresses transparency for OTHER companies has forever been shocking. CEOs are supposed to be able to navigate current times and be able to set up a company for the future. Apparently asking Christian to look a few weeks into the future was too tall of a task. 

He’s had a very eventful run as CEO of what used to be Glassdoor. If his mission was destroying a company in less than a year, then kudos to you my friend. Job well done."

2. Able to work remotely

3. Job isn't too difficult","These cons are based on my personal experience at Glassdoor:

1. Glassdoor pays employees based on the state that they live in, which I don't believe is an effective strategy. For example, all of California is considered ""Tier 1"", and all of Illinois is considered ""Tier 2"", regardless of where you live within the state. I did not see myself being at Glassdoor long-term once I realized that if I were to move, I would need to take a significant pay cut.

2. When it comes to the relationship between Glassdoor and Indeed, Indeed is clearly in the driver's seat. It was annoying to constantly hear about Indeed being blamed for something Glassdoor couldn't do, or about Indeed systems, or about Indeed Sales and CS, etc. This definitely made me question the business outlook for Glassdoor.

3. There is a blatant lack of racial diversity in leadership at Glassdoor (manager level and up). There are several CS teams that are almost completely made up of white people. This needs to change, and I believe it starts with hiring more racially diverse leaders. 

4. Glassdoor does not have the necessary data required to explicitly demonstrate a positive ROI to customers. This forces CS to resort to surface-level data points to attempt to show the value of Glassdoor and retain customers. Customers want to know how branding is helping them get more applies and hire more people, and as of now, Glassdoor is not able to clearly answer that question for their customers.

5. There is a lack of flexibility in how CS can go about doing their job. When I was there, there was a ""client engagement"" metric, which pretty much forced everyone to try to have a zoom call with each of their clients to conduct a business review. The ultimate goal is to retain and grow revenue, and there are many ways to do that aside from having a business review over zoom, and this metric limited creativity and autonomy, forcing many CS reps to waste time creating decks for clients that did not need it.

6. Morale is really low in CS and Account Management, and I believe that there will be a lot more people leaving in the near future."

Leadership (non-product) was a biz ops party through and through, and at times, felt a lot like you had to be ""one of the guys"" to be heard.

empReview_33180650,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW33180650.htm,As transparent as a brick wall.,2.0," Salesin Chicago, IL","May 14, 2020","1. The People. I’m sure you’ll see this in the Pros section on each review as of late. I will always be grateful for the friendships I made while working at Glassdoor.

2. The Experience. We did not have a solidified sales process at Glassdoor (see further information below), which in turn pushed us to get creative and to work even harder to see success. This experience will help me in sales roles and sales management roles to come.","I’ve chosen to list my cons by category. I hope you’ll take these seriously. You’ll notice a correlation between some of these cons and Glassdoor’s recently released “Company Values”. 

1. “We Are Transparent” is no longer true: 

Glassdoor is a company that was built on the foundation of transparency. For a while, we were living up to this and maintaining a transparent workplace. However, senior leadership (primarily VPs and above) completely lost sight of this value in the last year or so. I cannot stress this enough - You CANNOT preach the value in transparency to your employees, and then completely hide details of major decisions taking place within the company. 

For example, Glassdoor leaders, including Christian (CEO) and our Chief Economist, spoke in front of our entire workforce on multiple occasions to reassure us that Glassdoor was going to make it out of these COVID-19 times just fine. They told us we should not be worried, that Glassdoor made financial decisions in the past to prepare for something like this, and that we will protect our people AT ALL COSTS. They then put a surprise meeting on our calendar to lay off 300 employees, including President Club Winners, Top Performers, and some of our most Amazing Leaders. 

What they (Christian) neglected to even hint at was the fact that they had a different plan for Glassdoor - one that makes the company look a LOT different than it did a week ago. They had a meeting with the entire workforce the day after they laid us off to lay out a detailed restructure plan, with prepared materials, which had to take months or even the whole year to plan out with Indeed. Seems pretty convenient that they used COVID-19 as an excuse to execute a wildly different plan for the company. When Glassdoor was purchased, leadership repeated SO many times that we would not merge or start working too closely with Indeed. It is also unbelievable that Indeed did not lay off any employees - they just took our jobs and Glassdoor didn’t even offer reps/managers the opportunity to stay on the team (again, MANY of these laid off reps/managers were top performers).

2. “We are Innovative” …boy, I wish that were true: 

There were zero MEANINGFUL changes, advances or additions to Glassdoor’s GTM product suite in years. Sure, we would come out with some small update or addition to our solution from time to time, but it was never a change that prospects/clients deeply cared about. When entering into a discovery call, there was no way I could respond honestly when a prospect would say “I’ve spoken to Glassdoor multiple times. Your team keeps reaching out about new updates. Has your product changed at all or do you have any new products?” It was pretty embarrassing and made it difficult to effectively do the job. 

3. “We Are Good People” …well, you used to be:

Again, 300 people laid off, NOT based on performance. We are the people that built Glassdoor’s culture DESPITE leadership challenges. We worked incredibly hard for the company, and we made Glassdoor into what it was DESPITE our out of touch leaders. Glassdoor is 1 million percent NOT the same company it was a week ago. If you are attracted to roles at Glassdoor because of the culture, please do not be fooled. The culture will never be the same. 

The video you see in the first tab of Glassdoor’s Why Work for Us section highlights the people at Glassdoor…Ironically it includes many people who were recently laid off. 

4. “We Have GRIT”:

Growth: We were expanding, hiring, and looking to move into new offices in San Fran and Chicago. Obviously, COVID-19 impacted this and Glassdoor is no longer growing.

Results: Leadership knows how terribly they messed up last fiscal year when they made the books for hunter reps. It was an abomination. They divided books based on “spend potential”, which relied on incredibly inaccurate data in Salesforce. This meant that some of our best reps suffered and barely anyone reached their annual quotas. All we got was a small “sorry this was an oversight”, then the message preached to everyone was “keep working hard” …as if that were the issue. Great leaders and reps left Glassdoor because of how badly leadership messed up and because of the direction the company was going. This happened before layoffs were even in question, so Glassdoor was going downhill this whole past year.

Integrity: Most of us feel really let down that Christian and others did not even give us clarity or honesty about how Glassdoor was reorganizing with Indeed - they just blamed everything on COVID-19. This doesn’t ring “integrity” to me.

Teamwork: The time it took to make change or get simple projects done was ridiculous. For even the simplest change, we would have to wait on layers of leadership approvals, “leaders” dragging their feet, and conflict between leaders that have MBAs and those who did not delaying the process. It was so frustrating. 

5. SDR Org: 

While the SDR Org made some progress since year’s past, it was still a mess. Leaders having multiple long meetings weekly to try and make change, only to be pushed off by executive leadership as an afterthought. The SDR Org did not get the respect it deserves. These reps are the future of your sales Org, yet you consistently messed up their quotas, did not provide the correct training and enablement to help these reps succeed, and left everything on the managers’ plates to deal with. To all of the former Glassdoor SDRs reading this post: Know that you are incredibly valuable, and you were the lifeline of the sales Org. I’m just sorry executive leadership pushed you to the side. 

6. Enablement: 

Enablement was understaffed and could not provide the resources each Organization needed to succeed. Training and development were left on the shoulders of each manager at Glassdoor. Glassdoor does not have an official sales process or sales methodology. Therefore, SDRs and Reps alike had to work even harder to develop their own process and hopefully be successful. Luckily, this just made me better at my job. However, it is a disservice to your employees to not provide proper training. 

7. CEO: 

Christian took over for Robert as CEO, and things went downhill. Christian has shown on multiple occasions his inability to lead and get “buy-in” from his employees. From leaving meetings early that he was clearly unprepared for, to poorly delivering the news of layoffs, Christian seems to be in over his head. In one meeting, Christian bragged about creating the culture at LinkedIn…it left such a bad taste in so many mouths. Glassdoor is not LinkedIn, and I can promise you Christian had nothing to do with Glassdoor culture when it was strong – that was 100% the employees. 

8. Things I unfortunately dealt with while working at Glassdoor:

Glassdoor preaches transparency and even released a “Know Your Worth” tool to help candidates calculate what salary they should be making in their given field. This is SO ironic because my colleagues and I were specifically told we shouldn’t talk with one another about how much money we make…at the most “transparent” company around. It turns out this was preached to us because we were not all making the same amount. 

For example, I was being paid less than 85% of my colleagues. Let this sink in for a minute…I had a longer tenure at Glassdoor than any of those colleagues, I had the most experience at Glassdoor compared to those colleagues, and, like myself, these colleagues had zero management experience before entering into these roles. I was also told I absolutely 100% could NOT negotiate a salary higher than a certain amount, then I come to find 85% of my colleagues were being paid above that amount. Shocking for a company that talks so highly about equal pay for equal work.

There were a couple examples of male employees that were acting inappropriately at Glassdoor. I won’t go into the details here, but what I will say was during a full-blown HR investigation into one employee, for whatever reason leadership decided he could stay in the office and continue working while this was going on. Imagine the discomfort, fear, and anxiety this caused the people who were involved in that investigation. For some reason, that always stuck with me. Poorly handled. 

9. Important call outs:

If you would have asked me to rate Glassdoor 1.5-2 years ago, I would have said 4 stars. I always pictured staying with the company for a long time, and I am grateful to a few of the direct leaders I had that always supported me. 

Please do not respond to this review with a canned response. 

Please do not cover mistakes with excuses, and please do not preach about “how well we are being taken care of” post layoffs. A Lot of the information you see above happened before layoffs.

Please do not brag about creating an alumni slack channel…most ex-employees are likely too uncomfortable to post in there anyway due to the fact that Christian is in the channel as well. It would be a much more effective channel if people could connect and speak freely with one another."

1. Maternity leave - I was on leave this year and while out, I was told the information from our benefits that I was given was not correct. It was a very frustrating situation but in general, the parental leave benefit is really lacking. GD offers 12-14 weeks depending on your delivery. My friends at other tech companies are out for 5-6 months. 

As I am considering expanding my family, I am absolutely looking at companies that would offer more leave. It's disappointing because as a company that wants to be centered on employees, this is one area seriously lacking.

2. We recently partnered with a sister company and work closely with their employees. While there is improvement in that partnership, it feels like GD constantly got the short end of the stick. Both from a systems perspective and how we executed amongst selling teams."

Yes, it is realistic #2. Glassdoor actually adjusts targets if forecasting is off. I have never been in an organization that is proactive in this way or cares so much about doing right by clients. 

However, it is the last few months that have really defined the kind of company Glassdoor is. Starting in early January, the coronavirus was on the radar of our leadership team. Quite frankly, they were messaging about it before anyone knew much about it or cared. 

Leadership also made the decision to have us work from home and cancel travel weeks before other companies. They worked non-stop to provide us the resources and supplies we need. The messaging around this was that taking care of us and our families was a top priority. They have been flexible with everyone to figure out how we navigate this time professionally and personally.","I think there are challenges within any organization.

It's no secret that Glassdoor has been struggling to maintain competitiveness. Go ahead, read reviews from the past fews years. The product has evolved minimally and there haven't been actual new, revenue producing products built. It's clear that right now, Glassdoor's current products only matter in a bullish market.

I have been on a few great teams at Glassdoor and each one has been filled with encouraging, smart, and supportive people. 

Great benefits, unlimited PTO, new computers and IT has been incredibly accommodating by providing anything needed to make the transition to WFH as smooth as possible.

I am excited to hear the new focus will be around Salary Transparency, for a company that is built around transparency this has not always been the case. After I shared my salary with a member of my team, my manager asked me not to do this in the future. I am glad GD is starting to practice what we preach by embracing salary transparency.","Over the last 6 months, there has been a ton of uncertainty, with the massive layoffs and the future partnership with indeed it feels as if we have just molded to whatever indeed needs.

I have made lifelong friends here with both peers and leaders. Some of the managers that are still with Glassdoor are the best I've seen in my career. They genuinely care about their people on both a personal and professional level and truly embody what it means to be a mentor.,"I believe we tout ourselves as the model for employee culture and support but there are some major shortcomings.

First and foremost, maternity leave. Glassdoor offers their US employees what feels like the bare minimum in terms of paid time (12 weeks). What's more, is that there is an option to extend leave with unpaid time (6 weeks) but not only is this still not competitive in terms of total time off but it creates an incredibly complex situation for your peers and manager who are left to cover your accounts. Will you come back to your former book and earning potential? That is unclear. Ultimately, you are left feeling like a burden on your teammates who have to pick up the ""slack"" of your accounts while you're gone. We need better support for not only the parents on leave but also for the teams and managers who are covering. Help us create a system that drives cooperation and doesn't seem to punish the person who is out and who may have to forego their current book of business for a few more weeks with their new baby. No new parent should have to make that choice. We have all discussed and acknowledged how COVID is driving women, especially mothers, out of the workforce at disproportionate rates. Glassdoor needs to walk the walk and step up supporting all new parents. 

Quota has come up in other reviews and it's worth repeating - it's a complete disaster. Sales quotas are re-set every quarter and distributed 45 days (yes, 45 days!) into each quarter. That means you have 45 days to find a way to hit the gap you inevitably have especially if you over-performed in the previous quarter. It is extremely challenging to work ahead and genuinely provide the client experience Glassdoor is known for when you are chasing transactions to fill a gap. Help us get back to the customer-obsessed consultants we were before this shift.

Lastly, feedback. It's asked for everywhere - GLINT surveys, review reminders, in monthly review sessions tier-wide, and I very much love that about Glassdoor but nothing seems to be done with that information. As such, we as reps are stuck in this loop where there's this illusion that our voice matters, only to have comments explained away or ultimately left on the table. If you really want our feedback, please take it and help us understand how it is driving change."

Unlimited PTO is great and some added random paid days off other than holidays to let employees completely unwind. Great work/life balance and flexible working hours.,"Within the past year, the entire role of the CSM has changed for the worse. Stale product offerings that are hard to showcase ROI, also lead to redundant quarterly conversations with customers. Since CSMs are not trained consultants, it is very difficult to create change within customer base to showcase value of the products. Training for this is also very surface level, again we are not trained in Change Management or how to recreate and showcase a company's Employer Value Proposition. Depending on who your manager is can change your growth trajectory - some managers care and are highly involved in development whereas some take a back seat then come time for performance reviews, have no case to help you get promoted. Culture within the CS org is very negative due to the amount of change that has occurred within the past year. Everyone is burnt out and the employee engagement scores show how unhappy everyone is. Some true Glassdoor veterans have left the company and leadership doesn't bat an eye. In turn, they voice that if people want to go do less work at another company, then that's that person's problem. Leadership confuses being busy with mundane tasks with being challenged. Once you learn the talk tracks, the job can essentially be done with your eyes closed. Your day-to-day is full of deck making and calls which is easy but keeps you busy with the account load. There has been no real challenge to the role once you learn the basics."

Lots of autonomy and flexibility to get the sale done. Reps are very relationship/consultative selling focused. It’s competitive but also collaborative. Not a lot of slime. 

Sales managers are willing to help when you need it but also don’t babysit you. The sales culture is what keeps a lot of the sales reps here. You have the opportunity to win big. 

Because I touch base on Maternity leave below, I will point out there was recently additional fertility coverage added to our benefits that was a great step in the right direction. While our Paternity leave could be longer, it’s competitive and the flexibility with timing is a nice bonus. Many companies don’t offer that flexibility.","Maternity Leave: I am writing this review specifically to draw attention to our maternity leave policy in the US. We spend an enormous amount of time and internal resources striving to be an inclusive/progressive company, stressing that we will lead the way in multiple capacities, however the bar we set for our own maternity leave is the bare minimum for local laws. I would go into detail as to why this leave policy is detrimental to the women in our US organization, but I have faith that any glassdoor leader reading this would understand why this hurts a women's professional career and personal life. So with this, I ask you to do something about it. Chat with the women of this company and discuss a better policy. Increase the length to be competitive in our industry, add in a transition plan that allows mother's to slowly come back, build a network of mentors to help support new mother's. Ensure we have proper coverage while individuals are out. Built it into our organization. It is no secret women have struggled coming back, and some have recently decided not to come back. We can not pretend to be a forward thinking company with a bare minimum plan. I don’t think this is an unreasonable ask. Our colleagues in other countries have a more robust policy simply because their laws requires it. Is that our bar? Maternity leave is something that isn’t openly talked about because our women do not want to seem non-career focused, weak, or proposing something that’s self serving. Maternity leave is not a vacation. I am asking Glassdoor to do better. Lead the way. We are approaching a new fiscal year, dust off the policy and help the women of Glassdoor. I also encourage other women to speak up who are frustrated by this policy. I can’t believe I have to resort to an anonymous review. 

Quota Creation: How rep quotas are created and the metric we use to track revenue creates a false narrative of success and is fundamentally broken. It can be really frustrating as a rep. The plan resets each quarter and disproportionally rewards reps for selling short term display. Bringing on new customers, retaining clients, and growth on renewals doesn't move the needle. The leader board is a reflection of who has accounts that purchase display (not a dig on them, good for them). The most frustrating part about this is that I'm pretty sure SOPs keeps doing this because we don't have the time or resources to put together a better methodology. It's detrimental to our long term success as a company and (silently) effects things like product adoption and client retention. 

Dumpster Fire on the Front Lines: Reps are spending an enormous amount of time trying to navigate finance / contracts / data / CMPP launch etc. with the new partnership. Customers are feeling this pain too. It doesn’t feel like there is a real strategy in place and the admin side of the job has taken over to become where we’re spending most of our time. Reps are leaving because of this and then them leaving make it even worse. Sales leadership keeps praising revenue in all hands meetings but we are crumbling here on the front lines. We are drowning."

Couldn't be more clear that all of us are just numbers according to some of the new management here. It is not being received well. You have, and will continue, to lose great employees because of it.

empReview_40190510,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW40190510.htm,"Great People, Great Benefits, Typical Corporate Flaws",4.0," Lead Data Scientistin Chicago, IL","Jan 6, 2021","First off, really, really great benefits, comp isn't super competitive but it's very good and I understand my compensation very well. I also really like the transparency around compensation the company just undertook. 

I love my coworkers, most people are here to do good work and collaborate. Department leadership genuinely cares when there is tension or conflict and works to improve our communication, systems or team setup to mitigate friction.

I like my day to day work, it's a good mix of foundational work like creating datasets or dashboard, and more analytic/ML work like building models or analyzing patterns. 

My manager sets me up for success and trusts me to do my job. Glassdoor takes people management seriously (at least it seems so from my team) and asks managers to really commit to being people managers. My boss cares about my career and has helped me work towards not just my Glassdoor goals but my personal career goals.

GD is also flexible on things like taking an afternoon off for a doctor's appointment or changing your working hours to fit your schedule. I'm able to block off time in the middle of the day to go grocery shopping when the stores are empty.

The Senior Director of D&I really seems to care, I like him a lot. I trust Glassdoor to work to make it a more inclusive workplace, but we have a lot way to go to be someplace that's comfortable for oft-marginalized people.","There's a limit to the flexibility. I don't have kids but I've witnessed some stress among my coworkers with kids with WFH/stay-at- home orders/daycare shutdowns. There's acknowledgement that folks may be less productive but no reduction in workload.

Deadlines seem pretty arbitrary, we end up stressed out particularly around hitting product-based deadline when it seems the deadline just comes from ""it's on the roadmap"". Based on my work experience, this is very typical in software companies, but Glassdoor is generally smart so I don't understand why we can't get over this very very typical flaw. 

Corporate leadership talks the talk about caring about our mental health during mandatory WFH but we haven't really slowed down the pace of work at all (the thing that would do the most to help us cope during a one-in-a-lifetime period of stress and sadness).

The layoffs over the summer were really sad :(."

empReview_34243945,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW34243945.htm,Blunt Honesty,5.0," Anonymous Employeein Chicago, IL","Jul 15, 2020","I'll start by saying - I have worked at other companies in the past and partnered with clients in various industries where I was able to experience their workplaces. I'll be the first to say - Glassdoor is far and above superior to all of them in terms of courtesy and professionalism of employees, work-life balance and employee benefits. When I first started, I could physically feel the shift in the workplace unlike I had before!

A few pros I want to highlight:

+ Visibility. I feel completely taken care of and seen as a worker. I have never felt like ""just a number"" or ""another face in the crowd"". I also feel as if my voice matters, and if I want something acted upon or noticed, it will be! Meetings with our managers are always productive and they make an effort to ask if there are any questions we need answered or changes we would recommend.

+ Change happens! Again, never worked for a company that is so outright eager to gain employee feedback. They proactively ask for it on a regular basis. They encourage us to share the good, the bad and the ugly to be as truthful and raw as we can. If my previous employers asked for feedback, no changes were ever made and you never heard about it again. At Glassdoor, not only does our CEO and PeopleTeam read the reviews, read the survey feedback and openly ask for more, but they take this information and make ACTUAL CHANGE! They even asked us to write reviews about how we were feeling right now, knowing there may be quite a bit of animosity at the moment. Crazy, right? They recognize the power that their employees have and care enough to shift things to favor their people. It still blows my mind that one review has the power to change the forward motion of a company, but it's so true!

+ Employees. I can confidently say I am among some of the best and brightest individuals in the industry. My colleagues are kind, funny, intelligent, professional and always willing to help each other out. I feel proud to work alongside them every day!

+ Work-life balance. Managers encourage us to take time off, take a personal day or go on vacation. The unlimited PTO and fantastic benefits package is top-notch!

+ Work from home. I'll preface this with I enjoy working from home. I miss my people, but I don't mind not having to commute, sleeping a little longer, etc.. When our WFH order happened, we were told to let our IT team know if we needed anything - extra monitors, keyboards, desk chairs, desks, you name it. We were even given an option to buy work from home essentials we may need and expense it. This has helped make the WFH experience so much better. Again, I feel very supported and taken care of!","You can't have a lot of good without some bad, right?

A few cons I want to highlight:

- Layoffs. By now it's a broken record that people have written about the harsh handling of the layoffs in May. While it's difficult to tell 300 people they are being let go, I do believe a more conceited effort to give folks a ""heads up"" would have been extremely appreciated by both the folks who left and the ones who remained. While the severance packages were generous, the situation could have been handled much better and more direct from the first sign of trouble in paradise.

- Culture. While the people are all top-notch in the industry, some of the ""Glassdoor Lifers"" don't understand how things could be outside of working at Glassdoor. There are quite a few employees who have grown with the company for their whole careers and don't know what it's like working anywhere else. Because of this, they constantly compare the current Glassdoor to how it used to be without realizing that things could be much worse, as they are at most other companies.

- Concise forward planning. Lately, all the change feels very unstable and wishy-washy. It feels as if our service motion or future partnerships are changing every day. We hear information one day, and it's different the next. It would have been better if management would have taken a week or two in order to plan. Sit down, and really work things out before having us do what feels like this whole 'trial and error' thing to work out the kinks. The back and forth is starting to take a toll on internal teams and client relationships instead of having one solid plan that either succeeds or fails."

I moved to a new city where I didn't know many people. The reason why I wanted to work at Glassdoor was that I believed in the product and it was something that was useful to me in my job search. Little did I know that a short three years later I would be looking back at my decision to accept my first job at Glassdoor as one of the best decisions of my life. Many of my closest friends were made through my time on various teams throughout the Glassdoor organization. I know every review says it...but the best part of Glassdoor is truly the people.

- Career Progression -
There are plenty of opportunities for promotions for top performers. If you work hard and stand out, you absolutely will be moved from role to role quickly.

-Strong Managers-
I've had four managers at Glassdoor and every single one of them has been wonderful.

-Compensation-
Top performers are compensated like top performers. The ability to both hit and exceed quota is very real and can be accomplished by anyone who is willing to put in the work.

-Benefits-
Top of the line (and free) health/dental benefits with a ton of fun stuff around the office. Snacks, beer, ping pong, and darts. 

-Work/Life Balance-
Amazing flexibility based on manager and position. Employees are treated like adults and allowed to WFH or take PTO when needed.","Any company has cons no matter how great it is. Glassdoor has always done a good job taking feedback both from public reviews and internal feedback and laying out a plan to make changes. However, it sometimes takes longer to accept/see the issues and put into place fixes since we've grown so quickly.

-Sales Operations-
Many of our systems are very, very, very broken. This can occasionally lead to over or underpayments that you as an employee you have to watch out for. This SEEMS to be getting better lately and I know is top priority to be fixed this fiscal year.

-Billing Department-
As a sales rep, your compensation is tied to your clients paying (or not paying) your bills. This means that you are often times working with the Billing Department to resolve payment issues for clients. Our Billing Department is painfully understaffed and emails/Slack messages go unanswered for weeks creating tough situations with clients who expect resolutions quickly."

Being in the office surrounded by coworkers I considered my friends felt too good to be true. Every manager I had as well as my director were outstanding leaders, senior leadership on the other hand would fall under the cons. 

Opportunities: Account Managers typically don't spend more than a year and a half in seat before being promoted. Glassdoor also gave me the chance to work with leaders and provide input to help improve rep work flow and the client experience.","Deceptive: We had constantly asked for clarity around the future of Glassdoor & Indeed. We were blatantly lied to and told that the future plans in question would absolutely not happen. Fast forward a few months and 300 of us are laid off. Our CEO blamed this on COVID while it was later made to seem that this would have happened eventually for the exact reasons we were assured would never happen, and COVID just expedited it. I could not be more frustrated to know that I might still have a job if it weren't for the future plans with Indeed. Glassdoor speaks so highly of valuing its employees but ever since Robert stepped down as CEO that feeling left with him. Glassdoor has grown immensely throughout the years and it was only a matter of time before it made the shift from an enjoyable unique culture to your standard money hungry organization

Unorganized: Glassdoors internal processes are a hot mess. I have no idea how this company has been around for 10+ years and has yet to figure out an efficient way to renew clients. They are constantly restructuring the job description of Account Managers and Customer Success and the clients are the ones who are suffering. Getting promoted and transitioning to a new book is beyond sloppy for the rep and client, getting paid out on spiffs always takes 2 months longer than they promise, and anytime another department is looped into an email chain, you can guarantee you or the client will need to follow up at least 3 times to get an answer. I'm not sure if there's a part of this org that I could confidently say runs smoothly."

My team was amazing and everyone was so hard working and easy to work with. My manager was always positive and provided ample guidance and learning opportunities.,"Lost sight of the company’s core value, transparency. Pretty ironic for a company that stresses other companies be transparent.

When I first started at Glassdoor in the summer of 2019, I took the job mainly because it was so close to my home in Marin. The idea of a 15 minute commute in the Bay Area was a dream come true. About a month later after I joined, we were told we were moving to a new office in San Francisco in the fall of 2020. It felt like a bait and switch. This was never mentioned in any of the multiple interviews for the job but at least I’ll be close to home for some time before the move. We were told they would maintain the Mill Valley office for Marin residents for some time before the lease ended on the building, so I was relieved. But a contact in the Workplace Experience team said that the Mill Valley office was going to accommodate management and executives, not all Mill Valley residents. Thus begins the journey into lack of transparency.

Shortly into 2020, many of us were told we were being re-classified as hourly employees and our unlimited PTO was abruptly taken from us. There was an hour long meeting where this was positioned as a legal move that was actually in our best interest. But we all saw through that. Those who took very little time off and were planning a big trip or honeymoon were just left in the lurch. After some bad reviews, a few people leaving the company, and some harsh (but warranted feedback), our PTO was reinstated around March. This eventually did not matter at all as 300 people were laid off in the weeks following.

When COVID-19 became a threat to the market and industry, we were told from the onset that we had enough capital to avoid layoffs, that other companies were downsizing. But not us. Throughout February, March, and April we were told our jobs are safe. Even at our sales kick off event, they brought in our chief economist to tell us that we are “weathering the storm” and are positioned to avoid layoffs. This was in mid-April. Fast forward to May 7th where we find an all hands meeting on our calendars with zero notice. In that meeting we were told 300 people, about 30% of the workforce, was being laid off. It was shocking and completely out of left field after what we had been told for months. The icing on the cake was the follow up meeting where we could not ask any questions where our VP said a bunch of corporate speak. There was no exit interview, nothing. Just booted to the curb. Layoffs like this are not just split second decisions, this had to have been considered for some time. So we were lied to and given the false hope, likely for weeks or months, that our jobs were safe. People who have been with the company for years, top performers, and just all around hard working, honest people just lost their jobs in the blink of an eye.

Our CEO. He brags about company culture and the important work we’re doing when things were going well. But in moments of crisis or when asked difficult questions, he can’t speak with any sort of confidence. It was pretty easy to tell when we were not being told the full truth. Again, layoffs don’t just get decided without any sort of planning. So he kept telling us that our work is more important than ever all the while steps are being taken to cut the work force behind closed doors."

Along with that, allowing us the opportunity to move to different states is an awesome perk for those who want to take advantage of that. 

The stipend that was given for us to buy office supplies was clutch. I was able to buy a brand new desk that has made my home office a much more comfortable place to work. I thought the amount was more than generous and was greatly appreciated.

My team is awesome. We don't take things too seriously, but also work hard and collaboratively to get things done","I am not a fan of how slowly things move within the engineering department. This is due to the many bugs that occur on what seems to be on a daily basis with the admin side of the site. It appears that resources in the engineering department are slim and things do not get addresses as quickly as they should. It seems like there is more of an emphasis to push out new products than there is fixing our existing products. While I appreciate trying new things and trying to move forward, a lot of times the tools that we currently work with need fixing before moving on to something else. This slows down productivity for a lot of people within C&C and is frustrating to see a new product coming out when we don't even have a handle on the old ones or even something new that was already released that still might not function correctly. A lot of these things just feel like ""hurry up and wait"" situations. Hurry to push new things and then wait for them to actually work correctly. Again, this is referring to things on the admin side.

Also, I hate Workday. I would prefer a less complicated and more intuitive employee management system. I was given a small crash course on how to use this from a managerial standpoint that I still don't know how much of it works. When we are given new instructions on new things we have to do, the instructions infrequently match up with what I see in WD and don't function as the instructions say they should. Every time I have to do something new in WD, I already anticipate some sort of issue and most of the time I do end up with an issue."

- upward mobility - there was great opportunity to move up within the org if you're performing, indeed.

- benefits + reward - with upward mobility came comp increase and exceeding quota was quite generous and appreciated. benefits were also a perk","- transparency, what we were all about - had once been a pillar quickly became the opposite, indeed. there was no communication around direction other than ""we're a branding company now."" not much of a plan for the company through these times but leadership clearly already had plans in the works. there was never a mention of layoffs once and 300 people were cut off from anything Glassdoor related within 5 hours! quite harsh, indeed

- product innovation - in my 3 years being in direct sales, there was no product innovation. I had sold the same product each year. innovation actually became a new part of the GRIT culture but it seemed to be a few years too late as once a pandemic hit & recession was on the brink, our product was one of the first cut from client's budget --- overall, very curious to see how innovation is incorporated into future product plans because we saw minimal over the last 3 years

- sales operations - books were finalized anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks in Q1. as the timer for quota started, books were far off from being settled. sales requests were rarely completed in timely manner... seemed like a lack of headcount and resources able to get the job done as the current SOPs team worked tirelessly day in and day out

I love the people I met and it was the best work environment I could ask for!! I loved being able to go to work with coworkers who turned into my friends every single day. 

The office: Really nice updated office in Fulton Market, with free snacks, great views, an amazing rooftop, and free gym. No free parking, unfortunately. 

Career progression: Although unclear at times, I will say Glassdoor did see value in its employees and did hire within a lot. In my time there I had seen at least 10+ people get promoted, including myself, and it was great to see that. 

Benefits: Great health benefits, free food, bonuses, gyms in offices, dogs in office(Mill Valley office), unlimited PTO - however, they took this away for a month and then gave it back. 

I did learn a lot about myself personally and professionally at Glassdoor. It was definitely a great stepping stone in my career, and I will always remember my time at Glassdoor and think of it as mostly positive.

Although laid off, the severance package is one of the best I have seen.","Glassdoor will never be the same. The only good thing about it was the people and most of the good ones are gone. They're probably merging with Indeed - I mean selling profiles to clients for thousands and thousands of dollars isn't going to cut it forever. 

Transparency: Funny this is at the core of their business model, right? 300 people were laid off with no warning. A whole org, gone. They let go a whole org with no warning, and we’re really supposed to believe this was not planned after weeks of reassurance we were going to be ok during COVID. Doesn't seem totally transparent to me. 

Pay discrepancy: Where do I even begin? Throughout my years at Glassdoor there was never a clear reason as to why the pay discrepancy was so vast on my team. People in the same role making 20k more than others, and the professional pay scale they used to determine our pay had the incorrect job description. Also, pay in general is on the lower side. 

Senior Management: 
There is one leader in senior management for CS that should not be there. They have made MANY employees cry on multiple occasions and do not know how to have difficult conversations with empathy. They are simply rude. CS senior leadership was never fully transparent behind why changes were made. I am honestly not even sure what they did all day bc it was most definitely not making the org any better.

The role: There was NEVER a clear idea of the split of work between CS and sales. CS of course got blamed for everything and a Sales director was quoted saying “I wish I could blow up all of CS and start over”.. Really??? They would measure us on KPI’s that they set that didn't even make sense based on our scope of work, and then present those KPI’s in meetings in front of the whole org. Not to mention most of the reports for those KPI’s were broken. The whole CSS team was always overworked, undervalued, unrecognized, and underpaid."

from that, i've gotten back in touch with an old familiar friend. something this salty, overstayed-their-welcome individual hasn't spoken of in a while...

- 'pride' - 

pride for...
-the hours i put in
-the people i surround myself with
-in what each sale means and every dollar does
-us taking chances and risks again, not chasing competition but chasing progress
-defending free speech
-aspiring to create an inclusive society, challenging the status quo
-seeing us challenge conversations around privilege and race
-working to support gender equality and supporting gender identity

that all is in-and-of-itself worthy of my pride. i don't work here because it's easy, im proud to be here because it is hard. the result is growth. so daps n pounds to you glassdoor for going for woke, not broke, in all of the above.

some other aspects im particularly fond of:

-employee safety and wellness - we acted quickly and before many companies to move to WFH amidst a growing pandemic. since then, we've had various support groups, up-leveled communications to keep people informed, and genuine efforts (even if not perfect) to keep people engaged. I applaud the workplace experience team's efforts. 

-D&I - we're on a mission now people. our product is evolving to encompass more D&I transparency for employers and we're first on the list of companies acknowledging that we have growing to do. it's refreshing to see us admit our flaws but already be hard at work to create a safe space for all. our employee resource groups led by Jacob Little have been eye opening. i knew nothing before and through this team i've been more exposed to how i can be a socially responsible global citizen. it's in its infancy but has so much potential. 

*on the above - if you are black, latino, asian, indigenous, LGBTQ - you have allies here. we've got work to do, and we're extremely imperfect, but we've got you.","the layoff and restructure was the single most taxing and emotionally draining experience of my professional career. there is a scar tissue that i dont believe will fade. it sucked. the whole experience can go kick rocks and the mess that it created has spawned more uncertainty that is hard to navigate. however, i do believe that the time and energy spent to get through that restructure a more prosperous future.

i don't want to do that again and it's going to take me a while to get back to the output and productivity i once had. amidst all that, we struggle and continue to have an achilles heel in sales with good old fashioned communication and prioritization. what do we need to get done today, this week, this month - how are we gonna do it and who's owning it? ok. go. we have far too many internal meetings, deliberations and shifting messages. distill it down and keep it simple, especially for us on the front lines. it's been at times chaotic and other times mind numbing. the amount of problems we've had to solve for stacks miles high and people are tired.

then again we're doing something we've never had to do before; lay-off 300 people, pick up the pieces, and move the company in a new direction. it's not easy. but we did slack on the fundamentals and that slowed us down significantly.

someone once said:

“great leaders are the ones who think beyond “short term” versus “long term.” They are the ones who know that it is not about the next quarter or the next election; it is about the next generation.”

deep down though i know that despite all the frustrating and agonizing days that were this summer, they were meant to set our next generation up for something good. if you're reading this and you did something at some time to have someone's back to protect, coach, develop or counsel a colleague, direct report or peer through all of this, know you're appreciated. i speak for all of them."

Also, when I joined, the product vision was controlled by a clique of the ""OG"" leaders who had been with the company since the very early days.

The last year at Glassdoor has been a complete mess for Customer Success. Culture turned into nothing but gossiping and complaining.

Senior management is BAD, particularly in CS, and they are aware. They've shared our feedback of them and it's pitiful. They completely lack compassion in every single decision they make and constantly miss the mark. It started to become clear in the last few months that Glassdoor was really lacking vision and the ability to reinvent. Site traffic was down and our customers were bored with our offerings. CS superstars started finding new jobs/leaving. In addition, internally, there were many smaller announcements and decisions being made that were red flags to me. It felt like they were trying to cut costs in any way they could. An example would be, in Customer Success, they announced a re-classfication of employees changed us to hourly workers, and took away unlimited PTO (with no comparable alternative). This was all under the guise that it was ""legally required"" and ""in our best interest"" (so that we could get overtime). We all saw right through it. The announcement was tone deaf and dishonest. Teams started challenging the decision and then some were able to get reclassified and after feedback, they magically were able to bring unlimited PTO back (shocker) shortly before layoffs (meaning they would not owe us much if any vacation time). This is the constant theme of leadership, both in CS and company wide. There is always some shady motive to every decision. The fact that they were able to determine a layoff of 1/3 of the workforce was necessary so soon tells me all I need to know about the future of Glassdoor. They haven't been able to reinvent themselves and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they are one with Indeed. 

I would have the same feedback if I weren't laid off."

Our mission is more than helping people find jobs they love, it's about helping employers identify their strengths and weaknesses and how they can succeed as a company in driving new talent and keeping their employees happy. 

When CEM'S/CSM's get on a call with customers and are able to un-surface insights that employers never realized before and are able to strategize on ways to improve their ratings and engage their employee base-that is a WIN and that is what drives majority of the team and reminds them why this role is important and needed. 

Glassdoor as a product isn't the most intuitive so customers need a CSM/CEM to act as their partner and consultant to help them make sure they are getting the most value and ROI. To the surprise of sales and leadership (Robert, specifically), CEM/CSM's drive a lot of value for our customers...and it's not just a matter of pushing CPC's up and down like a robot. 

So when this team gets the chance to speak to customers, uncover insights, drive home value, and be positioned to make an impact-that is a pro and that's what will drive this team. 

Our new VP of customer success-she's trying her hardest, she's trying to drive home the strategic value of CEM'S/CSM's...maybe it's rubbing off the wrong way for some, but at least she is trying to open the company's eyes to our value as a team.","The con's: as of lately, there are many. And the pro I listed above is rarely happening because our CEO sees no value in the CS team and continually pigeon holes this team as CPC bid adjusters with little value to add. This view then trickles down to the sales leadership team who then also treats the CS team as their glorified secretaries and limits the team to make any strategic input with customers. 
But, here's the problem...the CSM/CEM team is over it, if you really think the value of this team is so marginal...then you hired the wrong people. The people on this team are smart, innovative, strategic, and dedicated to Glassdoor...and you give them no way to drive value. 

Robert-you have to read this review and understand that your lack of perceived value of this team has immense impact on morale. You can claim that yes of course you care and you value this team, but we know what happens in those QBR's and we know deep down you just want a team that obsesses over pace and if things aren't perfect and if budgets aren't being spent-that's the fault of the CS team. Did we ever consider that perhaps, Glassdoor growth in terms of traffic could be a factor? Or perhaps that our tool never works and is constantly running into bugs? Or that our search results surface job board and organic jobs above sponsored jobs? There's only so much that can be done as a CSM/CEM and if the goal is to hire bots to sit and adjust cpc's-then you should fire all these people....because they are too talented, too driven, too strategic, and too smart to sit in a company that doesn't value them.  

Morale is low. Super low. People are leaving left and right, and something will have to change to keep this team motivated. More and more tasks are being asked of CSM's and none of them are strategic or insightful...it's more busy work and reports that could be automated. 

The CS managers are not strong. All they do is acquiesce to the VP...and if you want to build a relationship with your team, then they need to know you're fighting for them on their behalf. Too many things are falling on our plates without any insight into the impact of the day to day. This team can't be successful if we don't enable the team to be successful. CS managers are spread too thin, they manage far too many CSM's and are unable to be help their team grow professionally. We should have more managers  who can really help drive value to certain client scenarios and be that advocate. And we should be hiring managers that really challenge and evaluate why we are doing certain things and un-surfacing potential issues (rather than right now, it's all just so reactive)

Performance reviews are such a joke. All we're told all year is ""great work, good job, nothing to report on here"". As a result, the team comes into their performance reviews expecting a raise or promotion and they get nothing. There is no real time feedback and CSM managers have nothing to add. You have to give insight into how to grow professionally and this should be feedback that is happening throughout the year!!! It appears that the only way to really grow on this team is to throw a hissy fit and threaten to quit...which has worked for some on this team, and not for others."

empReview_34353498,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW34353498.htm,a heartbreaking ride to the finish,3.0," Manager, Account Management","Jul 21, 2020","I've said it once and I'll say it again: the people at Glassdoor are above-and-beyond the finest group of humans you'll ever have the pleasure to work with. They've become my mentors, my friends, my best friends, and my family. Becoming part of that extended family is one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. I can remember at my first job post-college, a more senior colleague said to me, ""You'll never find a place this good."" She was so wrong...for the most part.

The personal & professional development was also top-notch. I'm not sure I fully recognized how strong our leaders were in providing that development on a daily basis, but I grew so much in my time at Glassdoor. From Guru Ganesh sales training to Gallop Strength Finder to SKO to Management Offsites, there was always something to look forward to in order to learn & develop. We definitely took our foot off the gas a few years back with emphasizing & enforcing proper sales training which was disappointing, but the roadmap that prior enablement leads crafted for our SMB org made up for that.

Fun. It was just fun. It wasn't until the Recruit Acquisition that things started to feel different and we lost that spirit we were so famous for. BAMF, Spirit Days, team events & offsites, interactions with executives in casual environments, SMASHie Awards, etc.

HR & Legal Teams - unfortunately, a lot of the strongest & best advocates left the company in the past few months, but our GC and team+ HR rep in CHI were incredible in every way. They cared about the people and, particularly our HR rep, helped develop the personnel. I also admire the Executive team for truly wanting to know their people. This goes for Christian and Robert -- it was never scary or intimidating to approach either or provide feedback.","I will start this off by saying that I was fortunate enough to make the decision to leave Glassdoor prior to the mass layoffs. With that being said, my heart is still crushed that this was the path we (yes, I still refer to Glassdoor as 'we' because I will forever be part of it) went down. This was always the plan to reduce the SMB arm and roll it more & more under Indeed. But to completely eliminate the roles of 300 people in one fell swoop and blame it on COVID rather than plan feels like a tacky PR stunt. 

When reps that I hired, trained, and managed are reaching out in real-time as it was happening, fear in their voice because they weren't sure if they received the infamous calendar invite, and then tears when they got news that they were axed. They had no one to go to because everyone was in the same boat. It was like a shipwreck in the middle of a dark sea -- no horizon in sight, no one nearby to save them.

Apart from the layoffs, there was several incredibly uncomfortable ""situations"" in recent years on the management front that should have never happened had proper training & protocol been in place. At a Sales Manager Offsite in ATX, the male leaders grouped together at the evening event to get a group to head to one of the local strip clubs. VPs, Directors, Managers. For (most of) the women there, it was a feeling of ""Do I put myself in an uncomfortable and go with them so I can be 'part of the club' or do I stay behind and risk being seen as too immature to hang with the top dogs?"" Thankfully, the majority of them decided not to go but how that crossed their minds as something appropriate to propose with their colleagues baffles me. It was the only time in my tenure that I actually felt uncomfortable and disappointed with our leaders and that I could miss out on an ""opportunity"" to ""network"" despite the inappropriate nature.

There are other instances, as with any tech company, of relations between manager & rep which led to hostile work environments and, in some cases, fear. There was never retaliation for voicing concerns, but you always knew who knew what and whose side someone was on based on how they interacted with you...including a few leaders (past & present). The org, as it grew, began to feel divided between sides of right and wrong."

The sales floor was a tight knit group and had each others backs through good times and bad.

There was also good upward career progression for those who performed at high levels.","This starts and ends with senior leadership. The most frustrating part of the recent layoff announcement was that the executive team simply did not practice what they preached. Throwing an impromptu all hands meeting to deliver such an announcement with no forewarning and then to follow up with no adequate explanation on why is just a bad look all around. 

For a business that is so adamant in urging companies to be fully transparent with their employees in order to be efficient - it was appalling to observe how often Glassdoor leadership left their employees in the dark and trying to guess what was actually happening. 

On multiple occasions, employees were reassured about their job security as well as Glassdoor's ability maintain independence from Indeed. This was communicated despite concerns voiced by employees over red flags that included a consistent lack in product innovation, stagnant traffic to the website, and sales operations teams that were overwhelmed quite frequently. 

Despite the enormous volume of feedback given from front line sales reps to help improve overall processes, this information fell on deaf ears time and time again as there was rarely any action taken as a result. 

For a company with such grand aspirations and a truly superior product, this was a horrible way to end things."

The technical systems are also pretty good. Tech gets updated fairly often, and there's a continual emphasis on improving process.

We had layoffs recently, and although there's no great way to layoff a lot of people, Glassdoor did it in the kindest way possible.","Senior leadership within departments can be pretty absent unless something is going wrong which can be frustrating. There's an acceptance that being aggressive is fine which can lead to some people (mostly men) being allowed to be really shout-y in meetings, or leaning really hard on people to get things done too quickly. This shoutiness is often out of knee-jerk defensiveness, which sucks. That's not everyone though. 

There's also a significant amount of bureacracy, the benefit of which is not obvious. Almost every capability has it's own ""operations"" team (business ops, marketing ops) and it can be confusing to know who to ask for things, and projects end up with bloated stakeholder list, making getting all necessary people into a single meeting basically impossible. 

Way too many meetings, but we're working on it. There's also a lot of process for process's sake, with no obvious value."

-Your reporting manager was often a fantastic person. 
-Awesome Offices","When I started at Glassdoor they were very much a company that wore their values on their sleeves. Heck I would say till this day they still do that to a degree. However, the reason it felt they followed their morals was due to how the company would always have us heavily involved in important topics like company direction. So, whenever something negative happened or we had to make a tough call it felt justifiable and relatable. 

However, Glassdoor was acquired part way though my tenure. I have seen this before and how it can completely change a company and of course feared the worse. However, they said much would not change and little did to their credit. Well that was till 2020 hit us… 

The company stopped talking to us directly and even our managers and continuously made decisions at what felt like a drop of a hat. We often see meetings put on our calendar that were not planned to randomly announce some sort of company wide change. Our mangers would often be aghast as they were cut off from the loop of information as well. Some of these changes removed large benefits, complete reconstructing of our teams and products, and leaning on outside resourcing vs using internal resources. Honestly, things you expect almost like a trope after a company has been an acquired. They also recently laid off a bunch of people with a same day of notice. As a company that is fueled by fantastic people and (was?) is a great company culture you made a decision that prevented us from giving proper goodbyes. This is not something that would have ever happened if it were a year or two ago. Glassdoor is slowly losing what made it unique and I imagine you wait a year or two before joining. I am sure there will be even bigger changes they make down the road that will completely change the shape of the company. Who knows maybe it will be a good company to work for still but I doubt the “people” aspect will ever be the same."

My Glassdoor colleagues are kind, and don’t hesitate to help each other when put in a position to do so.

The compensation is probably slightly above what would be expected at a company of similar size and industry.

The work life balance is excellent, and always has been.

The sum total of the work we do is ultimately positive, insofar as we help people find jobs. It’s way better than working at some pathological social media outfit, or selling cheap trash no one needs.","The first major con should be roundly apparent from reading positive reviews. “No Cons!!” Believe me, there are Cons. We have hemorrhaged talent in the last two years (I will float some ideas why a bit why lower down), and responded with questionable hiring decisions. While there are few, if any, hard-charging bullies and alpha-types at Glassdoor, there are many obsequious and uninquisitive employees.

The long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) is probably broken. Coronavirus has exposed how the incentive scheme as structurally uncredible. Personal performance is uncoupled from our business performance. That's how it's supposed to work, perhaps. But even aside from coronavirus, the LTIP is confusing and probably broken, with lower grants occurring after higher performance ratings, ostensibly due to some sort of adjusted coefficient nested into the grant calculus. My manager was not able to explain the LTIP to me during my performance review. I felt bad for her.

I was in a meeting a few weeks ago, part of which my husband overheard. He later told me, “I think I know what mansplaining is now…” I laughed. It’s true. Meetings often do sound like a fact auction, with enthusiastic participation by men talking over each other. Speaking of meetings, there are too many of them. Rare is the meeting with any kind of agenda or plan. It happened once a while ago; I remember that meeting. Meetings are constantly called, often ad hoc, and sometimes after work has been completed, because those involved have to figure out what was done and why. Often we will reprise a meeting the next day because the previous meeting solved nothing. It’s a negative feedback loop.

It’s not clear what Product is doing or is supposed to be doing; they come across as some kind of wannabe C-suite. The decisions about what Glassdoor's products look like and feel like seem to grow out of wishful thinking, or caricatures of job seekers that don't generalize.

My manager told me in my last performance review that the reason I was not promoted was “politics.” When I asked her what I could have done to earn a promotion (or just a high rating), she mumbled something about visibility. That was disappointing."

The salary and PTO are above average, as well as the amount of paid holidays that are offered to part time employees as well as full time employees.
Career advancement is huge since this is a start-up company that is growing rapidly.
Management is approachable and willing to help grow and advance employee careers.
Also, often times we are asked for our opinions to help improve the experience of glassdoor.com for the user....it makes me feel like management respects my opinon.
Finally, I have found that it is fun reading about other people's experiences all day....sometimes I forget that I am actually working!!","I guess the biggest thing would be working 7 days a week to keep up with all of the data.
Also, the work can be monotonous somedays doing the same ""type"" of analyzing for hours on end.
Sometimes working remotely causes a lack of communication and a lack of team feeling. There is also not alot of feedback about job performance because of the lack of daily interaction with management. 
Finally, working from home is great, but not seeing other people can sometimes make you crazy!!!!"

1) Great culture and energy - the people are amazing!
2) We are growing like crazy - fun and disruptive solution, people are passionate about Glassdoor
3) I strongly believe we have a fantastic solution that is helping people connect with the right opportunities to improve their lives, as well as helping employers find the right people to build better companies
4) Decent compensation/ equity
5) No dress code!
6) Access to execs - can make my voice be heard - I left a review that marketing wasn't communicating enough with sales, now marketing is doing a fantastic job of letting the sales team know what is going on with products and content - great improvement!
7) Sausalito feels like vacation every day
8) I don't feel unnecessary pressure to perform like I have felt at other companies - I will produce more because of this
9) I feel appreciated when I perform!
10) We are moving to a brand new office and will have lunch provided every day!
11) Flexibility to work from home! This is crucial! I was given the ability to work from home a few days a week because of high performance - I probably would have burned out having to commute every day for 2-3 hours","There are a lot of changes with startups: shifting managers, accounts, processes, etc"

Even though majority of Glassdoor's incredible, top-performing reps and sales leaders were driven out, I'm thankful that I had the opportunity to work with them.

Since I (like all those who were hired) was not given a proper training program to lean on during the early stages of my employment, I learned the ropes myself. It’s hilarious that this is what gave me strong sales skills: like my experience, the new hires that came after me had absolutely no direction from enablement, which opened the door for myself and my colleagues to put our work aside and help new employees. While I had no problem doing it, and it improved my relationships and knowledge of the product (hence my placement of this in the ""pros"" section), it's inexcusable that Glassdoor's enablement team left these new employees in the dark. But by all means, Glassdoor Leadership: spend a fortune on office plants & tacky decor instead of a strong enablement team.","Christian honestly had no idea of what we as salespeople did. How much can you appreciate your people if you lack an understanding of their roles? For a company founded on the basis of transparency and that is unique for reviews and ratings, Christian is completely careless to our feedback. On the contrary, I remember when Robert was CEO and would make his way through many parts of the floor when he visited the Chicago office; we all enjoyed listening to some of Robert’s own disco calls that he’d run and record for us, and above all else, it made us feel more united with our leader.

I actually recall a time around December when Christian made a (very rare) visit to the Chicago office. A manager from the SMB team put together a presentation on how to connect with CEOs, and Christian was asked to participate as we foolishly thought he could provide some good insight (how dare we think our CEO could offer us feedback and guidance!). To everyone’s surprise, he overwhelmed us with negative comments about how he as a CEO doesn’t like being reached out to and we honestly all left the meeting more discouraged than when it had started. He rushed back into the meeting about 5 minutes after leaving to give us some forced words of encouragement, knowing that he had messed up and trying to put a quick bandaid on it. No one was convinced.

Christian, in April 2020 when you thought you were being relatable taking zoom calls in your master closet and garage, when you thought you were being relatable sending in videos of you with your family working from home, you instead should’ve focused your energy on saving your top-performing employees that you would blindside only a few weeks later, or if nothing else, you shouldn’t have lied to us. Thanks for showing us your family, but now we’ve had to face the reality of perhaps not being able to support OUR families during an uncertain time when we were promised that this would not happen.

If you still aren’t convinced that he doesn’t value employee feedback, he also mentioned in that same December all hands that he was unsure of his current CEO rating. For any other CEO at literally ANY other company, I’d say that would be surprising but excusable. For a CEO running this very company, the one that is known for its ratings and reviews, the one that says we’re “changing the way people find jobs and companies they love through transparency”… inexcusable."

I remember when we started in a smaller office and all really became family. I truly never thought I would leave Glassdoor anytime soon, I thought I would have a long career there. The people I worked with will continue to be some of my best friends in Chicago, and I am thankful to Glassdoor for that.","Glassdoor is built on the principle of transparency. 

Christian, everyday you asked us to go out and fight against out competitors when we knew it was hard. We AEs/SAEs struggled, but we continued to do it, and continued to do it with comradery. We didn't make a ton of money, some of us did, most of us didn't compared to others at competitors, but we loved working at Glassdoor, and working hard because we believed in the mission. 

I don't understand what happened. One day everything was fine the next, 300 lay offs. 

We did that because you kept reassuring us that Glassdoor was going to come out on top, that if we kept working hard enough, we would have endless growth within the company. Christian, you lied to us. You brought on our Chief Economist to tell us that we are going to be able to make it through this, that we were underpaid for years because Glassdoor was preparing for some sort of inevitable downturn. You told us that we were going to be OK, and that we were well positioned for no lay offs. 

My question to you is, why did Indeed send out an email to its employees reassuring that they would not be laid off? How is it that Glassdoor let go of 300, many top sellers going to presidents club, long tenure, great experience, etc, and Indeed did not lay of any of its GTM teams? Was this the plan all along? Did you not fight to even keep your top sellers to merge into Indeed at the least? You did not protect your people, Christian. 

I am very grateful that we got the severance that we did, but the false hope you gave me really crushes me. I still can not believe what happened. I feel like I lost my family and community in Chicago in the blink of an eye. Honesty is always appreciated, and lying to us, leading us on, has lead to massive destruction. The culture you spent years building is now gone. 

I would like to quote something to you, Christian, that I read on LinkedIn:
""Laying off hundreds of people - crisis or not-is a massive leadership failure. 

Slashing jobs to save a company is like saying ""we had to throw some people overboard to save the Titanic"" and then ushering the captain to the only lifeboat. Your ship is probably sinking anyway because you have huge financial execution mismanagement problems...""..

.....or,... was slashing off the SMB team always the plan and this just helped you cover it?

Sad!"

Severance package is decent and you can keep your laptop.","This just isn't the same company it was 4 years ago.  I have loved Glassdoor, the best company I have ever worked for, but as they have scaled in size, they have also lost some sizzle.  I have witnessed this happen to other start-ups that scaled.  Some things just feel different at 1000 employees than at 200.  I used to feel very confident about the direction of the company and it's leadership.  Some of the changes being made right now (May 2020) with Glassdoor, a sister company and the parent company now have me concerned.  If it isn't broke, don't tinker with it.  My advice is to stick with the same business model that paved the road to where you are today.

I am an award-winning, quota-hitting, promoted, top-shelf sales rep who just lost my job to COVID-19.  The sales dept was just gutted - aren't sales teams one of the last groups to go in a reduction in force due to an economic downturn?  You award me for my efforts and success and then you send me packing.  Cut the dead weight instead and keep top performers.  I don't get it.  My heart is broken.

Glassdoor has gone out of it's way to create inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community.  I applaud their efforts and they have done a fantastic job!  Unfortunately, Glassdoor put too many eggs in one basket.  Black/AA, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, Jewish, Catholic, Christian, etc all take a backseat to LGBTQ+ who is riding shotgun.  Glassdoor, have you ever temporarily changed your corporate logo to include the name/colors/logo of any diversity group other than LGBTQ+?  Would you change your green logo to black for black history month?  Or perhaps add a Cross, Star of David, or Santa hat to the corporate logo during holiday season?  No, you wouldn't do those things.  But you did incorporate the rainbow colors to your corporate logo during pride month.  My advice is to work as hard for other diversity groups as you have done for LGBTQ+.

Lastly, employee salaries are below national averages according to Glassdoor's very own ""Know your Worth"" data and salary info.  They try to make up for it in other areas like office snacks, Patagonia swag and benefits."
empReview_6581556,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW6581556.htm,Young. Gifted. Positive.,5.0," Marketing Managerin Sausalito, CA","May 12, 2015","Summary

More than any company I've ever worked for, Glassdoor practices what it preaches when it comes to the art of organizational transparency. For example, everyone has a say when it comes to new hires (a first in my career), excellent work is publicly acknowledged and management openly discusses results, company changes and the future on a regular basis in all-hands meetings. Glassdoor also boasts the youngest worker demographic of any tech company I’ve worked for, which makes it an energetic, fresh, positive, fast-paced, “Let’s try this!” environment.

Detailed Pros

-Supportive—B2B managers and colleagues have your back, let you know when you’ve done a good job, single you out for love in team meetings
-Fast growing and open—management honest about future of company, quarterly results
-Hiring process—taken very seriously, everyone on team has a say, vote and stake in decision
-Smart, bright people—few, if any weak links, which makes B2B run like a Ferrari
-Great business model and mission—helping employers make great hires makes you feel good
-Open floor plan—conducive to collaboration, quick brainstorms, getting things done fast
-Generational—youngish worker demographic comes with less professional baggage and hang-ups, less “We used to do it this way at XYZ company” attitude
-Training—new hires go through serious onboarding
-Dog friendly environment—reduces daily stress, helps lighten things up
-Great benefits—unlimited PTO, catered lunches, gym, team outings","-B2B/B2C divide—sometimes feels like two separate companies under one roof
-Open floor plan—no privacy, often leads to cacophony, hectic environment
-Sales territories—constantly changing, moving targets lead to churn in Sales, disrupting Marketing sales enablement efforts
-Dog friendly environment—often a distraction to business at hand
-Food—more healthy snacks would be appreciated
-Generational—youngish worker demographic can turn office into free-wheeling party"

empReview_9665385,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW9665385.htm,Things are not so good right now,3.0," Enterprise Account Executivein Mill Valley, CA","Feb 22, 2016","Glassdoor is a fast-growing late stage start-up making a real impact in the world - we're helping people find great jobs and helping companies find ideal talent. The people here are awesome, starting at the top with our CEO. Robert is an inspiration to all - he's ethical, passionate, approachable, intelligent, and willing to help the sales team. In fact, everyone is willing to help whenever assistance or advice is needed. 

I love the flexibility of working from home, when it’s necessary – this is a real benefit that matters in an area like San Francisco where traffic can be unpleasant. 

There's great opportunity to advance in your career and get promoted, if you work hard and stay focused. Glassdoor has been the best place I’ve ever worked.","Things have changed quite a bit over the last several months, and it’s sad to say – this place isn’t as great as it once was.

Compensation is now far lower than many similar stage companies in the SF Bay Area (48% below national average for Enterprise Account Executives, according to Glassdoor's own data) and worse, we just received our compensation package for the first quarter of 2016 (2 months late), my quota has tripled from last year and my commission rate has been cut by 50%. This means I literally have to sell 3x what I sold last year to make the same amount of money. Everyone in sales understands that quotas will go up each year and at a start-up like Glassdoor, commission rates will go down – but this is painful. Glassdoor has a model that punishes people who perform at a high level. Instead of rewarding the best, Glassdoor uses a formula that makes everyone’s on-target-earnings the exact same – which means that if you are terrific at your job and have years of experience, you have to sell more 2-3x what someone who started last week has to sell to make the exact same amount of money. It feels like this model is a short-sighted blitzkrieg to cut costs for an IPO, but will lead the most senior talent to quit, which will be much more challenging for Glassdoor long after the ""funding event"" that is ""going public"". It is quite strange considering we preach nothing but culture, transparency, and keeping employees happy - yet our recent actions defy all of that logic. 

Sales Operations has been a true pain to work with over the last several months. It seems like they get thrills on kicking deals back to us after the sale, asking us to get amendments signed and new paperwork completed. This is needed on almost every deal because it's difficult to create a quote and agreement correctly. Now, it takes multiple days of approvals at several levels to process quotes and send agreements - and as mentioned, it still doesn't work right.

There are a lot of questions around territories right now - a major important part of the sales structure that feels like it was neglected. What’s most painful is that the way territories will be divided is based on a scoring methodology that is inaccurate. Many people have of anxiety around what our territories will look like in just a few weeks.

Morale on the sales floor is low; many feel defeated with our new comp plans – with anxiety/ uncertainty about how things will be moving forward. I feel like I am in a bad situation, but when I hear about how bad other reps quotas and commissions got hit, I cringe."

Incredible benefits and perks 
Very talented manager and director level leaders","Of course, the way things ended with a mass layoff that had zero warning was not an ideal experience to go through and not an ideal way to end my time at this company. I think this situation could have been handled much differently and I would have had a lot more respect leaving the company had we not been promised job security over and over. However that does not dictate my entire experience with Glassdoor. 

I do wish that there was more insight and delivery on certain products, processes, and specifics that were promised to us throughout, that we never saw through. The product essentially stayed the same and was not evolving with the industry all the while, having constant meetings about product evolvement and new additions to our company that never came true. This hindered growth within the sales org.

The other thing I wished was improved upon were internal processes. There were massive delays on very simple requests, cases, etc through operations, finance, and other non-client facing teams. As a sales individual it felt as if we had zero support behind the scenes. Everything was kicked back to us in some way shape or form. This puts a bad taste in clients mouths giving them a sense of no support as well and has impacted many renewals therefore taking away revenue from the company. There needs to be tighter SLA's for internal teams, and more of a focus shift to a true sales organization which requires way more support for those teams. Glassdoor's reputation will continue to suffer if there is no support to sales and no support for our customers.

Career progression was tough. Internal interviewing came with a lot of politics and was not the best experience or process. This needs improvement if you want to keep good sales people, path for promotion needs huge improvements."

Never have I worked at a company with so many awesome people. Glassdoor invests in getting you to know your team and it's a huge benefit.

I have the opportunity to solve interesting problems, hardly ever have a boring day and am always learning and being pushed. 

On the perks side we are well taken care of with catered lunches, a gym, gym classes, kegs, dry cleaning pick up, plenty of snacks and happy hours.",Growing pains feel are starting to show but I see a little bit of an effort to keep things moving smoothly. People wear a variety of hats and project owners seem to shuffle so it can be tough knowing who is responsible for driving the project. This definitely slows things down. There are lot of rotating/changing top priorities which come in a fast paced environment. Overall these cons are pretty expected in a startup.

In addition, if feels SUPER good to be part of a company who's products actually work! Honestly, I feel 100% confident in selling Glassdoor products, because they have helped every employer I know. And it's great to work for a company where I can come into the office everyday (or work from home), and know that I am helping people everywhere find the jobs and companies they love.","With great growth, comes some pretty big changes. There's been some good and bad changes to the comp structure of the sales team. Things are getting better, but change is of course not easy. 

Communication is also getting much harder across the organization, I'm not always aware what the product teams are working on, or what is coming down the pipeline. Also, finding the right person to speak with about x,y, or z may be hard if you're just starting out here. But at least with Glassdoor we maintain a small org feel, so there are still weekly huddles, and I still feel like I can walk into the CEO's office, and talk to him about anything. That's great."

The leaders and managers I've had the chance to work closely with shatter stereotypes by being highly approachable, innovative, and (most importantly) humble. Overinflated egos are virtually non-existent at Glassdoor, and recruiters are trained to value and search for humility in candidates who are hired. I consider my team and managers not only people I deeply admire and respect, but people who are close friends and allies. Executive leadership values the opinions and feedback of every person within the company regardless of tenure, and I have seen them pivot strategy and implement changes based off feedback received by employees that other companies would consider toward the ""bottom of the food chain."" The work/life balance at Glassdoor is also outstanding. Open PTO policy, total flexibility and trust with taking time off when ""life"" happens. I've never once been denied a time off request. Working here, you feel like you are working together on something that truly makes a difference in the lives of others. The reward of helping others land their dream job is hard to beat! Glassdoor is refreshingly transparent, friendly, and kind. Keep up the great work!","Glassdoor has long left behind its status as a startup, but doesn't yet feel like a truly rooted and established tech company. Lots of best practices are still being fine-tuned and discussed, and it sometimes feels TOO agile, with employees often finding themselves being introduced to new tools, process, and team structure before settling in to the existing one. Leaders are clearly still ""figuring things out,"" but are at least honest about that to employees. If you don't value change/variety as part of your work day, Glassdoor might not be the place for you."

We can start off with the culture...unbelievably positive! When I started I was new to the industry, the role, and, truthfully, had no idea what I was doing! Whether it is my manager, desk neighbor, or anyone in the entire org, EVERYONE is SO open to helping you! This company really goes above and beyond to make sure their employees work hard, and get rewarded for their efforts. The commission structure is great, salary is good, and the benefits are absolutely amazing.

One of the components I love is the ability to work from home. While I do not take advantage of this because I love coming into the office to work, I was sick for three days of a week and my manager encouraged me to stay home. I decided to work from home and even then she was checking in to make sure I was getting enough rest and not over doing it. Going off of this, the work/life balance is great!

The culture has turned around within a year and now is toxic.  People are unhappy and rapidly leaving while leadership continues to distance themselves from problems. 

We strive to be the best of the best (as we should since we are a review site for companies) but fall short in culture, internal communication, vacation benefits, and innovation. 

Front line managers and directors are out of touch with the day to day workload and job duties. They are almost never in contact with clients and lack the skill and willingness to support you with internal navigation and problem solving because of system problems. Employees are rewarded for staying quiet and putting their head down instead of welcoming feedback, new ideas, and improving the status quo. 

Colocation is encouraged by leadership but not enforced for themselves. Without local leadership, the culture will continue to deteriorate. 

Unlimited PTO removed on 2/1/2020 as we are now hourly employees. Work life balance was one of the main reasons people stuck around. But now more and more teammates are leaving each month.  Rollout of this change was poorly communicated caused more disconnect with leadership.

empReview_11636275,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW11636275.htm,"The best place to work, even on a bad day",5.0," Vice President of Marketingin Mill Valley, CA","Aug 21, 2016","Glassdoor is the best place I've ever worked and somewhere I love to be everyday, regardless of the challenges. We are led by an amazing CEO and a top-notch leadership team full of real people who roll up their sleeves, work hard, and really care. It's challenging, it's fun, and it's rewarding.

The entire Glassdoor team is passionate, kind, humble, and smart. People generally remain optimistic and ""find a way"" in the face of any challenge. 

When a company is doubling or more year after year, there are a lot of challenges scaling the business. We are having many of these challenges, and we've made some pretty big mistakes this year, especially in the GTM organization.

Challenges and mistakes will happen at any growing company. It's how you handle these challenges and mistakes that matters. I think this leadership team is handling the pressure extremely well. I've seen many companies going through these types of pains disintegrate. They've become paralyzed, reactive, political. The exact opposite is happening right now. Leadership is coming together, working together, staying calm, and solving problems quickly. I've never been more proud or honored to be part of this team. 

The problems we are having right now are temporary, most of them are not systemic. Some of them are self-inflicted, others are due to late investments in critical areas, but they are on the path to being solved. 

I frankly think our challenges were bigger a couple of years ago. Our product efforts weren't scaling, we had virtually no operational expertise in the company, the company was very divided between consumer and B2B, and there were some key leaders in place that were not a culture fit and were making poor decisions. The leadership listened to the feedback then, and we have solved many of these issues in a very short period of time. Our product team now has great leadership, our business operations team is making a big impact, and we have the right leaders in place. Our CMO and other leaders have done a great job bringing both sides of the business together and working in harmony. 

I'd pick Glassdoor on its worst day over just about any company on its best day. Solving the challenges of a rapidly growing company is what gives meaning to the work. Solving them with great people is like nothing I've ever experienced.","It's inevitable that a company will make mistakes or under-invest in certain areas when growing at our pace. You can't throw money at everything at the same time. When working at a company that is growing this quickly, it does take patience as we have to make tradeoffs in our investments in order to be fiscally responsible (and we are that, which I truly appreciate).  We've had some bad luck in certain areas along the way too. We are now making the right investments business operations, product development, and user growth. In my opinion, key areas we now need to work on are: 

1. Modeling. We still need to improve in how we financially model and measure our business. I think we have a solid understanding of what drives growth. We need to ensure that all areas of the business are delivering on the inputs needed to realize the growth we want. Much of this is in the form of product deliverables, user growth, more operational and enablement support for sales, and excellent product performance that commands a higher price point. It's unrealistic to put expectations of large productivity and efficiency gains on the shoulders of our sales reps without other things materially changing to support that. They are working hard, and they are an amazing team who can get more productive with the right investments - but many of those investments have not been made. We also need to fuel our growth in a more balanced way where we are contributing to the growth from many different areas. We lack the basic visibility to understand the key levers in the model and where we are/aren't delivering. We're too big for that - we've just got to fix this.

2. Sales Operations/Sales Tech. We all know we are short-handed here and are hiring as fast as we can, but it's starting to have a real impact on the business. It's becoming painful and it's becoming a frustration and causing a morale problem because we want to move quickly and efficiently and we can't. Our operational structure was built when we were small, and has not scaled well with our growth. It's not just technology, it's also business processes. Breakages of both are occurring more and more frequently and are starting to have a real impact on the business. We've got to get serious about this and put the right structure in that can accommodate the current business and grow and scale over time. 

3. Investment in our Sales Team. We've grown this team to the point where it's not about just getting it done out of sheer will and scrappiness. We need to shift gears and realize that we have a large, global sales team and we are under-invested in many areas needed to support this team. Our leaders have such aggressive hiring to do that they don't get to spend enough time with their teams. They need help. They also do not have the reporting or playbooks they need at their fingertips to manage their businesses efficiently because no one has had time to build those things. And many business and sales processes have not been clearly defined. Finally, our sales enablement is very light for the amount of catchup that we have to do. We need more investment here. We have no way to know if the training is sticking - and in a lot of cases it is not. This is nothing against the sales enablement team - they just do not have the resources to get the job done properly and they do not have enough input from leadership as to what the proper sales/business processes should be in the first place. Sales reps, SDRs, and Sales Managers are overloaded with so much information and so many constant changes that many of them do not know how to effectively utilize our latest system and processes, which makes it difficult for them to succeed. We are leaving a lot of money on the table due to the lack of investment here."

Beautiful HQ office with good health benefits and free lunch. Nice to have dogs running around the office as well.","With so many changes and new upper management it has really put a bitter taste in the mouth of sales reps. Way under paid and unrealistic quotas. Glassdoor can be a hard sale because of content issues that reps have no control over. 

There are too many people on teams and it's not fair to managers. They are never around and to no fault of their own. They are asked to hire more and more as well as sit in endless meetings and do pipeline updates. Managers can't help reps to be strategic or help a rep to develop. 

New people that have been brought into upper management and jumped in without really knowing how our business worked. Feels like they really have no regards for people who came before them . Everyone feels like they are being pushed out in order to make more headcount for the new Chicago office where they can pay them less. 

They are getting very strict about WFH but with negative energy in the office and large egos reps don't want to come in. They just want to hit their number."
empReview_15781367,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW15781367.htm,Bring Back That Lovin' Feelin',3.0, Enterprise Account Manager,"Jul 6, 2017","There are a lot of reasons I love working at Glassdoor: 
1) We are making a major impact in the landscape of recruiting. The mission to help people everywhere find a job and a company they love is meaningful and is something I feel excited about doing every day. I enjoy the conversations I have with our employer partners and I feel like I'm helping them shape their strategy. It's rewarding work. 
2) The people! What other reviewers say is true... I work alongside the smartest, most hard working and driven individuals. It's a true team environment where we all help and support each other.
3) My managers. I've been incredibly lucky to work for and learn from two really talented individuals in my time here. I always feel they have my best interest at heart, work to remove obstacles, coach me with valuable feedback and push me to be better. While my two managers have been very different, have both taught me skills that will benefit me well past my tenure at Glassdoor. 
4) Add all of the perks like ongoing professional and EQ training, free lunch and snacks, team events, an onsite gym and classes, free health benefits, a beautiful and sunny location, dogs in the office... it truly is a great place to work.","I am sad to say that it feels like the wheels are falling off in so many areas of the business, and it's easy to lose track of all of the things I love about working here. Each department is stretched incredibly thin. B2B Product rolls out half-finished, not well thought-through products, Data Science is understaffed and can't produce the reporting the sales team needs, Product Marketing can't keep up with sales collateral because they have to jump through 100 hoops to get something developed then approved, our Customer Success team is understaffed/overworked/underpaid and managing too many accounts .... it's no fault of the people in these departments, many of them are incredibly talented, it's that we need more of them. 

Specifically for the ENT Account Management group, I can't even begin to calculate the amount of time spent pulling reports and building presentations for client meetings. This needs to be automated so we can our time strategically selling into our accounts. Like ASAP, not ""it's coming."" A number of positive changes have been made this year (i.e. reducing the number of accounts each AM manages, fewer reps under one manager, newly created/to-be-formed Customer Insights team) but if you're looking at this role, you need to be prepared to work a lot of late hours, travel around the country and likely only hit 80-90% of your quota. 

Quotas and Compensation? We'll look past the fact that our Fiscal Year started April 1, but we didn't have our quotas until May, nor our Comp Plans until the first week of July. Quotas are structured with unrealistic expectations of revenue growth when our product hasn't historically performed well enough to justify a larger investment from our clients. Although a number of people on the team were asked their input on the structure of both quota and comp, it was all in vain as it doesn't seem any was taken into account. Comp is below market value and an unattainable quota means you're not hitting your OTE and even more underpaid for working 60+ hour weeks. Not to mention you just plain don't feel like you're winning and successful."

Glassdoor has an amazing culture where the people will become some of your best friends. The managers are here for you and will work as hard as possible in order to see you succeed. Unfortunately there is a little disconnect with upper management. When scaling a company, you need to figure out ways to cut costs and become profitable, that's a known factor. But, you don't necessarily do this by drastically lowering commission rates all at once, to the point where the new OTE seem unrealistic. You do this slowly or else you lose the driving force behind what makes your sales team operate; the though that you can make good money if you work hard. Suggestion for those thinking about joining the sales team: maybe wait for 6 months. Management is going to need to create a realistic comp plan that allows for contributors to make money. It will get done but may take some time.  Maybe sit back and think about joining the back half of this year."

You can feel that at the core of everything we do. It's the reason why we all go to work! 

My Colleagues: I love the people I work with! Glassdoor recruits and keeps some of the brightest, most creative, friendly, funny, welcoming people I have ever met. My teammates encourage me to be genuine and real and provide the personal and professional support I was looking for in a team. My efforts and my personality have been acknowledged and appreciated here.

My Manager: My manager is incredible. He is remarkably talented at coaching individual members as well as coaching to the team which has made us all tight knit and one another's biggest fans. Personally, he has taught me a process, pushed me outside my comfort zone, and cultivated a confidence in me that I am so grateful for. He truly is a role model and a dear friend. Our entire team sees his tireless dedication to our team, to the company, and, most importantly, his family. He is all around a stellar human that we are lucky to know and work with. 

Our Leaders: Leadership listens! I wrote a review about 6 months ago that was quite critical about where we were as a sales org. This included a critique of new processes that had been implemented that seemed to be slowing us down, as well as the tough quota targets. As a side note, that review was still 4 stars because I love Glassdoor. Anyways, since then, our middle management, VPs, and Exec Team responded to the reviews on Glassdoor, addressed concerns in town halls, implemented a new internal feedback loop (Glint), and, over time, solved for our biggest problems by reducing quotas and giving the sales team the opportunity to earn back lost dollars due to poor initial plan.  

At the first half of 2016, Glassdoor had dropped the ball but I am happy to say that they have picked it up and are running hard toward the goal line. I love this company and am so proud to be part of a an org that REALLY LISTENS and WANTS TO DO RIGHT by it's employees.","Our biggest strength is our biggest weakness: we are a start up. Start up means that sometimes things are humming and jiving and other times things are broken and disorganized. 

Career Development and Training could be improved. Processes are a work in progress. We have been iterating for a few years so innovation to product and positioning is welcome. 

Although there are things to be improved, if I've learned anything in the 10 years I've been in the workforce and the 3 years I've been at Glassdoor, it's that things are not always perfect. I've also learned that really great companies and wonderful leaders seek to learn from those not so perfect times to make the organization better moving forward. Glassdoor and our CEO does that."

Free lunch and snacks. The pay is finally starting to get competitive. Most people there are very nice. Most managers have flexible policies around work hours and working from home.,"Something dark lurks within the waters of Glassdoor's Sales Ops team, and it has the team's members fleeing for their careers.


1) The Only Live Culture on the Team is in our Yogurt

In the most recent employee satisfaction survey, the largest word in the word cloud was ""toxic"". Pressure to perform is sky-high, which is part and parcel of any Sales Operations gig. However, the team's culture has shifted dramatically to reward people who manage up well while undercutting the work and reputation of their peers. People are now hired and valued based their pedigree; Ivy League MBA with Management Consulting is the profile du jour and the only voices truly valued on the team (note: this is not unique to Sales Ops, but proliferates throughout the Operations organization).

Most teams within Sales Ops work in silos and show little interest in understanding work outside of their purview. When collaboration is necessary, tensions inevitably flare. Even team outings are usually segregated by team lines, with the exception of a few open-minded individuals. Rather than encourage cross-pollination, leaders often simply skip the events altogether. We tried a big team-building offsite a couple of months ago. It did not help.


2) I Find Your Lack of Vision Disturbing

Like sand in the desert, our org chart shifts with the winds. By my last count and without exaggeration, we restructured the Sales Ops team no less than 5 times in 2018. Many of those restructures were due to key staff leaving the company (which speaks for itself), but it embodies the lack of a cohesive vision for the team. We almost never talk about team vision, and when we do, there is no follow-through.

Our processes are a mess and everything is manual. There is no documentation because no one has time to document them. We’re told to automate everything, but efforts are poorly scoped by our Sales Tech team and always fall short. Efforts to implement scalable policy are met with extreme resistance from sales leadership. More on that later.

Our Sales Tech Stack is a mess. Salesforce is a disaster, and there are no plans to shore up the foundations there. We are something of an urban legend amongst the CS team at Salesforce, as our implementation is the most cluttered and least efficient that many of them have seen. The result is inefficient process for our sales team and an inability to effect productive change within the environment.
We've recently taken to cycling in old tools that we've already tried and didn't work. We'll see how that goes.

Our priorities shift more often than our org chart. We frequently enter the week with a frantic email telling us what ""the only thing we need to focus on this week"" is. OKRs have been out the window for most Sales Ops teams for the last 2 quarters, and when I shake my Magic 8-ball and ask if that will improve, it always says ""Reply hazy, try again."" Every time. 

I have a ticket in with Mattel to troubleshoot.


3) ""And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!"" - The Grinch

A key part of Sales Operations success lies in its relationship with Sales. Somewhere between trust and shared vision lies a nirvana of effectiveness and efficiency.

Unfortunately, none of that exists at Glassdoor. Our relationship with Sales is incredibly dysfunctional. And, in spite of my criticisms above, the lion’s share of the problem lies with the inexperience of sales leadership. 

Glassdoor is a strong believer of promoting leaders from within. However, when that is your only method of hiring leaders, you get the Peter Principle run amok. Simply put, there is not a sales executive at Glassdoor that has been anything other than a frontline manager prior to joining the company. And it shows. The decisions made at that level are short-sighted; primarily for the benefit of individual sales reps and to the detriment of our ability to scale. There is little accountability holding leaders to the commitments and decisions they make. Perfect is the archenemy of good. And we learn everything the hard way.

I have seen instances where our lack of experience on the executive team has left us incapacitated when facing the kind of difficult challenges every company encounters during hyper-growth. Every trial our company faces becomes a crisis where the leaders charged with resolution are only equipped to make very educated guesses on the path forward. Again, this is not limited to sales, but it's especially prevalent there."

It is the perfect place for me in my life right now, professionally and personally. I used to think that a job could only be but so good -- that it could only satisfy two of the three major requirements (pay, people and project). My husband says that he learned in business school that you will, in fact, only ever get two of the three. However, I have found all three at Glassdoor. A great salary, funny/hard-working people and a project or work product that challenges me every day and gives me the autonomy I've been looking for.

It's a senior start-up, as I like to say. Glassdoor has the nimbleness of a start-up with none of the uncertainty. It has the professional polish of a large company without the politics or bureaucracy. It's a great place for those who know what they want and have the drive, passion and mid-career experience to make it happen.","As a member of the marketing organization, I don't experience many of the downsides that others might. Overall it's a very strong organization. However, to provide balance, here are the areas that need improvement:
-Clear focus on business objectives and resources. While there is so much to do with the product and in the space, Glassdoor is only 750 people. Prioritization is key. To do everything we want to do, we'll have to either focus on the 80-20 rule more, or hire more people.

-Location. I love working on the waterfront, but the commute is hard for 85% of the company in Mill Valley. A larger SF office with opportunities to work from there would be great not only for current staff but for our recruitment and retention efforts.

-People of Color. No need to beat around the bush, I'm not talking about ""diversity."" I'm referring to actual people of color in our ranks. We need more. We have diversity of thought, gender, socio-economic status, etc. However, Glassdoor truly struggles with hiring and retaining people of color. It's no longer okay to say that we're not as big as our contemporaries and, therefore, cannot put the emphasis on hiring people of color. It's imperative to our innovation and growth that we invest in racially diverse communities."

Here's the top of my ""pros"" list.

1. People - My direct team was composed of professionals who are expert at their jobs, have fun with their work, and are genuinely great people. This extends to the Enterprise Sales and Customer Success teams as a whole. These are the groups I worked most closely with, and it's a talented team overall.

2. Creativity - My leaders gave me a ton of trust to create new opportunities for the company. They trusted me to innovate our approach, and get the job done to grow the company. I believe I delivered by qualifying for 3 President's Clubs in 4 years. I'm very thankful for the trust in me, and hope that I've passed this spirit on to my team.

3. Knowledge - I grew my skills substantially during my tenure at Glassdoor. I was put in several situations where I had to ""figure things out"" in order to drive growth. I had to push the envelope regularly, which grew my knowledge-base over my 4 year tenure. These attributes will stay with me as my career moves forward, and I'm thankful for that.","The company has changed dramatically from when I joined 4 years ago. It was a disappointing end for me, given the highs my team achieved during my tenure. 

Dramatic change is to be expected when you're in growth mode, and especially after an acquisition. However, the top ""cons"" listed here are why I dropped my rating to 3 stars. They definitely played a role in my departure from the company.

1. Senior Leadership - The ""feel"" is dissipating. Everything is ""rationalized"" through spreadsheets, and decisions are made via endless hours in conference rooms. Many key departments are run by an MBA who doesn't have prior experience leading in said capacity. This has created a lack of first-hand customer knowledge, and is causing a diminished connection with team members who interface with customers and prospects every day.

2. Cross-Functional Partners - Team members in other departments are willing to help, but the company is separated into silos. Each department has their own OKRs, and few of those correlate with overall customer success. As a result, time spent selling for reps is greatly reduced. Reps routinely spend hours, and even days, waiting on cross-functional support. Most reps end up just doing things themselves to deliver to customers on-time.

3. Lack of Innovation - This may be number 3 on my list, but was probably my biggest issue. The company continues to push high growth targets...but isn't producing new, monetizable products to drive that. The market is changing dramatically, and the company is falling behind. Even if the revenue numbers look good at an aggregate level, there are significant risks to the business that will manifest themselves over the next 12-24 months if true innovation isn't realized.`"

Office in Marin on water","Senior execs are out of touch, petty and fail regularly at good communication. Leadership at all levels like to talk about transparency but do not walk their talk. No females on board of directors. Executive team very male-centric. Decisions are made by the few at the top while others are left to manage the day to day with low pay and very low team morale everywhere. Favoritism abounds on finance team, with one select group getting very obvious preferential treatment. 

Culture is young, clique-ish, immature. Salaries are low and HR likes to make excuses for not giving people raises commiserate with their titles, promotions, experience and past performance. Lots of excuses why things cannot be done for certain people while rules are bent or flat-out ignored for others.

People with no management experience are promoted without adequate training. 

Overall, the same old same old - there are pets who get the money and the promotions. If you dare raise your voice about a sincere concern or problem, you're vilified. Poor behavior and harassment overlooked if you've been at the company long enough. Members of the leadership team are overly dramatic and have temper tantrums. If you are an individual contributor, you are expected to suck up this behavior. Men are treated differently than women. Favoritism abounds."

Growing pains have the inevitable cause and effects and some of that has made its way to reviews on our own Glassdoor page; a good reminder that we are not immune to our own solution. Part of what makes Glassdoor so unique is that we WANT to be held accountable. Leadership stands behind the transparency and accountability that are the threads throughout our mission.

Last week we celebrated the life of a former colleague. Her father spoke of his gratitude for the people who loved her well and supported her living the last years of her life with dignity and pride.

The flexibility Glassdoor offers is amazing.  Have a doctor appointment?  No problem.  Need a day to work from home for whatever reason, sure - go for it!  Having a baby?  We have AMAZING maternity/paternity benefits.  Want to take a vacation, enjoy it because we don't have a PTO policy!

On the sales side, while there are challenges, I believe that our managers do fight for us.  I have yet to see a manager throw a rep under the bus - they typically give all the credit to reps when it comes to successes, while taking partial responsibility for failure when it happens.  You don't see that too often!","The negative aspects of Glassdoor have nothing to do with the culture, but rather around sales and our processes.  Over my time at Glassdoor I have had multiple territories with different comp plans that just don't make sense. They ask you to sell into regions of the world we don't have a viable solution for, and create products that are impossible to implement and price effectively/competitively.  The reps that cover the major metropolitan areas like SF Bay Area and LA absolutely destroy their quota.  Reps elsewhere, not so much, but have the same comp plan. 

For an organization that prides itself on transparency, this is the most opaque sales team I have ever worked for.  Managers are literally in closed door meetings ALL DAY every day.  Our sales approval process gets bottle necked to certain key directors that are simply never around to approve deals and thus it is an endless waiting game.  Want to know about new products/features that are coming down the line?  Not gonna happen because we aren't told about them until a day or two before they launch (or the morning of)!

Speaking of sales, it would be nice to have a quota when the year starts!  It is now mid February and we still don't know what our Quota/Territories are for this quarter or our fiscal year.  We get the fact that we're rethinking our model year over year, and working for an organization that is in hyper growth mode, but you can only ask so much.  You can't tell us we are behind on a plan, when we don't even know what the plan is.  

We can only take so much ""trust us, your leadership team is doing what is best for you and the business long term.""  The reality is, while we want to be flexible, and do what is right for the company because we believe in what we do here, all of these decisions made behind closed doors, in endless meetings, negatively impact the morale and bottom line of your employees!"

Shortly after I started, Glassdoor became my second home. I was surrounded by some of the smartest people I had ever met. I was immediately challenged and pushed to what I thought at the time were my limits. I can honestly say that 3 years later this is all still true, and I have learned more about myself in the past 2 1/2 years than I ever have in my life - both personally and professionally.

The ""you can"" attitude that my managers have instilled in me is something I will be forever grateful for. This is not a general statement- l am talking about every single manager I have had here at Glassdoor. This ""you can"" attitude is now engrained in my bones and I feel like the possibilities and opportunities for me are endless.

While my leaders empower me, my colleague's inspire me. I COULD NOT have gotten to where I am today without my amazing teammates. The amount of collaboration seen on a daily basis is unparalleled. 

When you establish yourself, show you are here to work hard, and collaborate and innovate with your colleague's, you earn the respect and trust of management and with that, I feel far from micro-managed. I end up pushing myself harder knowing that it is MY responsibility to hit MY numbers, and falling short impacts what's on MY paycheck. But not only that, I push myself hard so I can win for the team, for the tier, for the org. This is the type of culture Glassdoor has built, and it still lives from what I see on a daily basis. Who said culture was fading in Mill Valley!? If you were on the sales floor today, you may have felt differently . . .","I reminisce about the ""good old days""  and of course, get nostalgic. We have grown tremendously and can't expect the people and the business as a whole to be functioning the same as it was when we have nearly doubled in size year over year. With change and growth comes frustrations and these frustrations have caused some turmoil personally and across the sales org, all of which have been mentioned in prior posts: CSM re-org has disrupted AM productivity, Quota's seem unattainable, morale is low . . .

During that time, I was fortunate to be a part of incredible growth. Being part of that growth, especially in a leadership capacity...was challenging but rewarding. I hired some wonderful people, collaborated with them, watched many of them grow and flourish...had a lot of fun, and learned a ton along the way.

There are a lot of wonderful things about Glassdoor. I moved across the country in 2013 to take the position I did, and that type of a move isn't something I took lightly. I did it because I believed in the mission, and wanted to make an impact with an organization that expressed the need to grow the Customer Success division. At my core, I'm more passionate about the customer than the average person, and I knew Glassdoor was creating something that felt different and they expressed the need to bring in someone like myself with industry experience. I couldn't have been more excited to start. I was provided with an opportunity to help product development, scale multiple divisions all while managing and supporting the Glassdoor Customer. Over 3.5 years in my role, and in leadership, we grew the team from 4 to 55 and had almost no employee attrition. We were able to do this because of the culture we created. Even with flat budgets, under-market compensation and lofty goals of 10-15% retention increases, this was never easy but we were united in the mission and hit our goals.","Even with this success, it was always challenging to work at a company that doesn't provide professional development. I had no leader/mentor focusing on my individual abilities, recognizing strengths (properly rewarding them) and most importantly, helping me improve and my professional flaws. I was hungry for someone to teach me more of what I needed to know to take myself, the organization we built, and the customers I so cherished to the next level.  

It became clear Glassdoor and I had different ideas for my future. I was ready to help continue growing the company, where our CEO preferred to hire from the outside. Admittedly, it was painful given all I'd been a part of. Rather than use my industry knowledge of nearly 10 years and more than 3 within the organization to help continue growing what we had built, I was asked to focus and build out a new division that wasn't part of my skillset, wasn't what I was hired to do and certainly not what I moved across the country and worked so hard for. It was clear this was the beginning of the end. 

Since the new leader was been hired, the CS culture has changed dramatically. Maybe that was the intent? If so, it has worked. The new leadership's actions, behaviors and words are contrary to the spirit of teamwork, and the culture that Glassdoor was founded on. Chastising/scolding individuals in meetings when asked about how changes impact others, and have people coming to me crying on a daily basis at how unhappy they are - I knew it was time. Knowing that our CEO was allowing this to happen and turning a blind eye because it's not an area he knows well, it just takes a toll on you, no matter how much faith you once had in the organization. I left a company and a team I loved because I no longer could sit by watching the team and culture we built change so dramatically. It wasn't something I was on board for and several others since I've left have felt the same. Attrition has gone from nearly nothing to incredibly high (for Glassdoor, and specifically for the past history of the CS team). But like many of the reviews here, maybe attrition is the goal. To turn over the old and bring in the new. And if so, it is working incredibly well."
empReview_22026336,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW22026336.htm,"Sales - great place if you are positive, patient, and adaptable",4.0," Account Managerin Mill Valley, CA","Aug 17, 2018","* Great People from Peers to Leaders - working here is genuinely fun and the people are awesome! In addition to senior leadership being super personable and humble, I've made some great friends here and am almost always happy to come into work every morning to see my coworkers/friends even though I have the flexibility to work from home! I do not take this for granted as I know what it’s like from past jobs to dread going to work every day.

*  Constant Learning Opportunities - there is a lot to learn in Account Management. From formal Franklin Covey Sales Training to tribal knowledge (and a pretty unique knowledge-sharing sales culture) to working with clients in a variety of industries I am constantly sharpening my skills. Even when you know how to do your job there is ample opportunity to get involved cross-functionally, with trainings, interviews, etc and continue learning about business.

* Managers in Growth - tend to be awesome. I’ve worked closely with all of the managers in SMB Growth and have found them to all be incredible people. I've loved both my managers and they have definitely been instrumental in motivating me to stay at Glassdoor through good times and bad!!

* Flexible Schedule/Travel Opportunity - Managers in Growth are understanding about working from home which is amazing. I don’t use it that often but it’s great to feel like I am trusted and treated with respect. I often feel like I truly am the owner of my own business (my book of clients). Working with clients across locations and industries is really fun and we get the opportunity to plan our own travel to in person client meetings which is awesome!

* Mission - easy to get behind. For all the random tech companies to sell for, I might not be saving lives but maybe I’m helping a company hire people who are :)

* Dogs in the office are the best thing ever, definitely make my day every day!

* Office Location - being on the water in Mill Valley is amazing. The reverse commute is easy, it is serene environment and beautiful to get out of the city and have lunch outside every day

* Food - I genuinely appreciate the daily catered lunch, tea/snacks. They have options for every dietary restriction which goes a long way!","* Culture on the Decline - Our culture has suffered a lot recently, and I'm not sure why or how to fix it. The Fun Committee has pretty much disappeared. Monthly happy hours that used to be a blast have virtually zero attendance. It makes me sad how impersonal/automated company and department wide communications have become.
* @Sales Leadership: Bluejeans Sales Huddles suck! It was way more fun and motivating when we convened in the cafe. I am guessing these measures have been taken to save time/efficiency but the result is a disjointed community and everyone is multitasking, not actually paying attention to the meetings as we would in person. This also takes away face-time with leadership that we really enjoyed! I also feel this way about the Video Company All Hands - which I’m guessing <50% of the company actually watched. I don’t think I'm the only one who STRONGLY prefers real meetings.

* SMB Growth partnership with CSS on Job Ads is NOT working. We need to allow high-spending job-ads accounts to have CSMs. I want to sell my clients the product that is the right fit to help them succeed, but it is getting to a point where i am fearful to move clients from slots to ads because there is a major risk the campaigns will not launch and will not perform as they are barely managed. When growth reps are measured on MCV and selling POCs we are being set up to fail attainment-wise if the trials we sell do not even launch so we obviously can’t prove performance in a short period. Glassdoor is an amazing product when we launch and when educated CSMs are managing campaigns - please help us help our clients succeed!!

* FY19 Sales Changes are a Bummer - We moved from a Bookings attainment model to Monthly Contract Value (MCV) and it has been a nightmare. Even after finally understanding how it works (far into the fiscal year, and I’m sure some people are still lost), it became apparent how flawed this model is. It is not motivating in the way Bookings was and forecasting is a headache and a half. MCV doesn’t make sense for getting promoted/switching roles or leaving the company because there is no way for reps to get credit in these situations and it's shocking that there was no foresight into this. Leadership tries to spin it as that we should do what is best for the business but at the end of the day that is an unreasonable ask - I am a sales person and am motivated by getting credit for what I sell.  Please switch back to bookings in FY20!

 * Forecasting Mess - I know this has been mentioned in other reviews. We switched forecasting tools form Clari to Aviso which has been a struggle since Aviso doesn’t work, deals randomly fall out, notes won’t update etc. I spend 2x as long on forecasting as I used to when we used Clari. This tool was supposed to be rolled out to use at the start of FY19 (April) but it is now almost half way through the year and it is still not working. It’s hard to get excited about promises made at SKO when the result is this far off year after year. How does it take this long?

* Onboarding is Not Great - important note if you are considering accepting a job at Glassdoor: our on boarding experience in growth can be a bit of a “find your own way” experience as training is geared towards new business. Luckily, people are generally really nice and happy to help, but it’s not a hand-held easy training experience last time I checked. Be ready to make your own way, start-up style... even though we are not a start-up anymore which is awkward.

* Billing & Sales Ops are both ridiculously understaffed, which has a major negative impact on sales teams. Leadership/HR if you read this - please please hire more billing people!"

A great office space right on the water’s edge, a quick reverse commute over the golden gate bridge, plenty of snacks, provided lunch, beer, etc. Essentially all the perks you’d expect from any startup/tech firm worth its salt. On the whole Glassdoor did a very good job on hiring the right people who added to a shared value system, worked hard (to reinforce it), and as a consequence, developed a cohesive culture. 2 out of my 3 managers were fantastic. The Scotch Club. Finally my teammates, truly good people who made it a pleasure to work at GD. I only hope I was able to do as much for you as you did for me. Thank you.","GD has been fortunate to scale rapidly over the past ~3 years and in most cases hired or promoted the right people to facilitate the next stage of growth (CFO, CHRO, GC, CRO, etc.). Missteps are inevitable in any organization and promoting one of the directors who I’ll give the fictitious name of ""Za"" is one such example. Za simply does not posses the hard and (surprisingly) soft skills/emotional quotient required for the position.

From a professional vantage this director lacks business sense, has demonstrated an ineptitude for sales in general, is void of the maturity and composure required to lead effectively, has advanced cronyism/favoritism, is unable to work effectively with cross-departmental leaders, and disregards the counsel of direct-report, managers who are more experienced and capable.

Decisions can’t be made solely on one’s qualitative perception of the business..that is grossly negligent. Especially, when you are responsible for the livelihoods of 50+ people and tens of millions of dollars. You need to be able to create, interpret, and apply data to your policies/decisions just as much if not more than your “feelings.” In many instances this director demonstrated an alarming inability to do so. One example is the promotion criteria created by this director, which eschews reps' merits for promotion (what proper performance looks like) in place of an regressive, out of touch, idealistic criteria. 

Involve your managers in the discussions that are going to impact and shape the tier. Don’t just hear them out because you think that is what is needed to temporarily appease them then put forth a unilateral policy. Rather apply their good ideas and fight for them. This is what other directors have done and as a consequence they have benefited from the collective brainpower of their managers...this is also business 101. By not doing this you make it seem as if you are hiding something, have a hidden agenda, or are threatened by ideas not of your own making. The most important outcome of this unilateral approach is the tier’s interests aren’t being properly lobbied for.

A cogent suggestion is to let your managers operate with independence instead of treating them as if this is their first job out of college. I’ve never experienced the level of of redundant micromanagement as I did while reporting to Za.

Denying promotions to the reps who closed the the two largest deals in tier's history because you don't like they deal types is extremely selfish. The reps fought hard for these wins and no matter the circumstances surrounding the deals’ pre or post closure you need to recognize and reward the wins."

Finally, openness and innovation are encouraged.  We know that it takes a village and everyone needs to be thinking creatively about how we run our business to keep it moving at this pace.","We are growing and when there is immense growth, there are pains associated with becoming a 'grown up' company.  Glassdoor is right in the middle of that right now.  Leaders are doing their best in preparing for the change with changes to structure, processes, comp plans, etc but there is  a subset of the team members who are still attached to the Glassdoor 2012 ways.  Yes, the culture was great but evolution is needed to move to the next level.  The legacy team member base tends to be entitled, putting in less hours, really not connecting to the new mission and goals, because they want to keep the company in its teens.  When leadership makes a change that appears to be painful for team members, those people complain within the office, post on here and as a result things are changed to the 'softer, gentler' old way.  We can't continue to grow where the squeaky wheel always gets the oil.
Engineering resources are low - as is in most companies.  We need a team of people who can fix customer bugs and continue to innovate.  While our Engineers are smart and can execute, the product growth in to the Enterprise space has been slower because there just aren't enough of them to build.
Salaries are lower than market.  This is a known and was acceptable prior because many of those earlier team members got a bunch of equity and the perks were great.  One of those perks is the perceived 'unlimited PTO' which is not really unlimited, it's Open with Manager discretion. This was misinterpreted by team members to mean all the vacation you could consume regardless of business impact.  That's caused some concerns from the vantage point of keeping the business moving as quickly as possible.  Lack of strong leadership led to this and now there's clean up involved to get everyone back on track."

 - You close sales in 2-3 calls for Small or Medium Businesses.
 - Pipeline is always moving because of the quick sales cycle.
 - Everyone knows who Glassdoor is so when you are on the call it's always warm.
 - Monthly quotas keep you motivated the whole quarter long which creates a fast-paced environment

Great culture for growing a career
 - More than anything, people aren't judgemental. Be yourself and no one will give you a hard time. 
 - Managers have your back.
 - You never feel like anyone is looking over your shoulder.
 - You can expect to be promoted every 12 months if you're doing well and the managers like you.
 - You learn sales methods from professional programs instead of learning everything on your own.
 - People are suuuuuuuper friendly and helpful
 - If you like to drink, the SF culture just seems to drink a ton so get ready for that
 - There's an SF office, a Chicago office, and a few international offices. If you want to transfer offices, live in London, etc. Glassdoor is actually open to it!

Perks and Benefits
 - CATERED MEALS are AMAZING! They've really found caterers who bring you great food every single day
 - Health, Dental, Life is all covered for you and partially covered for family members but it's top-of-the-line insurance providers
 - Work-Life Balance is something you determine with your manager. If you want to come in early and leave early, great. If not, most are expected to be here from 8-5 with an hour lunch. However, if you ever need to leave or stay home or go on a trip, they are super flexible and don't give you  a hard time. 

Leadership
 - They've had their struggles in the past but recognize that and have changed a TON. 
 - The VP of Sales will actually sit in a room with sales reps and ask them what needs to be changed and they actually listen.
 - The CEO listens to feedback and consistently is trying to improve transparency and communication. He's also just a genuinely good guy.","Here are the few I've found
 - This place is LIBERAL. Good for half of you, maybe bad for the other half of you. All of SF is really liberal in general but if you're already living here then you're used to it. People aren't  judgemental if you are republican, but I feel like you'll just hear a lot of left-wing chatter and that might bug some right-wing folks.
 - This place DRINKS! Once agian, good for some, maybe not for others. If you don't drink or don't want to be around people who do, maybe Glassdoor isn't for you. Once again, no one will judge at all if you don't, but there is a lot of that here. 
 - Leadership is still making changes to improve compensation and I would say change in general is a minor challange. 
 - Some leaders don't seem super strong, you know? Like, they aren't the type of people everyone wants to follow.
 - Compensation is enough to get by, but could be better. Like I said, they are making changes to get you more money.
 - If you perform, you'll get promoted. But there is definitely a ""cultural fit"" aspect to promotions as well. So know that to get promoted, managers will definitely have to like you. If you aren't likeable, you might not even get hired so...... nevermind"

Every training we were required to go to was pretty much a waste of time. No company wants to know how long you've been in business, how many awards you've won nor do they want to hear about tons of stats you've made up. They want to tell you their problems and hear how your product can solve them.

My first was sold to Novell, the second was sold to Macromedia.  I thought I understood how successful startups are run.

Glassdoor sets a new standard.  These guys really know what they're doing, and understand what makes a company successful.  I've learned new ways of thinking here, not just about coding, but also by watching our CEO and the VP of Marketing.  They do things I would never have thought of doing.  (This is the first marketing person for whom I've ever felt any respect!)  Any startup is a gamble, but working with these guys gives me a lot of confidence that we will succeed.

Both the CEO and VP of Engineering value individual contributors and creativity, and will let you know it.  If you just want to code, and do it well, you'll be appreciated for that.

The quality of our work life is great.  The company is headquartered in beautiful Sausalito, California.  Our offices are a block from the water, and 1/2 mile from kayak rentals.  We can watch the fog come in over the mountains.  On Friday afternoons we open beer and wine and sip while working at our desks and listening to music, which we all take turns D.J.'ing off an iPod.

While it's a bit of a jock atmosphere, the company is gay-friendly.  (We're just north of San Francisco, after all.)","Since this is a small company, there is limited opportunity to learn from your colleagues...  If you're not comfortable going out and doing some research, you probably won't fit in here.  Likewise, you need to be fairly self-directed.  Everyone has to be willing to step into different roles, if necessary, so you might end up doing something onerous like PERL scripting, but these kinds of things are always temporary.

On occasion, you'll put in long hours.  (I've put in a lot of 10-hour days, and occasionally a 12-hour day.)  These are voluntary, and I've never seen anyone pressured to work late.  People just understand that hard work now will (hopefully) lead to compensatory rewards later.

The company is currently a boy's club, and needs some female employees desperately.  (I think that everyone realizes we need more balance.)  I'm hoping that a year from now this will no longer be the case."

I get to work with some of the smartest and most innovative people I have ever met. Very collaborative work environment, beautiful office and great company culture. There is an on site fitness trainer, workout classes, and gym.  Generous amounts of food, free lunches, coffee & snacks every day. Lots of cute doggies around the office. People dress very casual in whatever is comfortable. Lots of fun company events and outings for people to bond. The company is fairly generous with supplies & technology for employees. It is an exciting time to join the company as we are expanding internationally & growing rapidly!

Glassdoor is an industry leader in employer branding, which is a new and developing area for the recruiting industry. Sales team is selling something that we can feel good about, since it aligns with our mission. Accomplishments are recognized by teams, by the sales department, and at a company-wide level. The CEO even comes and hugs sales reps. Managers truly listens to employees and are always working to improve processes or solve problems. There is a lot of very hands-on training, so there is tremendous room for personal growth and skill development. 

The marketing team does killer campaigns to keep a healthy flow of inbound leads coming to the sales team. New SDRs get to work warm inbound leads, so you are usually cold calling people with some knowledge, interest or familiarity of Glassdoor. Tenured SDRs work outbound leads, which is great training on prospecting, getting to decision makers and navigating an organization. There are clear goals & room for growth. SDRs are promoted into Account Executive/Account Management roles. Quota is realistic and everyone is always willing to help others learn or grow. The team has clear rules of engagement that prevent overlap and promote fairness.","There is constant change as part of a growing company, which can lead to some over-communication. BCC and reply-all feature needs to be used less in email threads. Salesforce needs to be cleaned up since there is a lot of bad data. Some teams seem understaffed for the work load (such as IT and sales ops). 

The commute is kind of a pain unless you live in Marin, which most people don't. Right now, the company only compensates for people who commute via bus, but most people drive independently and pay a lot for bridge tolls. Not a lot of healthy food or options for people with allergies/dietary restrictions. Feels like some people are working 24/7 although everyone has different perceptions of work/life balance. 

Inbound SDRs are highly dependent on marketing campaigns, so any lulls in marketing make it harder to hit numbers. Some of the sales reps don't understand how to work with SDRs and should communicate or show more appreciation for our hard work. The office is a little crowded as the company is growing & the sales floor can get a little noisy."

People believe in the vision, and they believe in their peers, and go to lengths to show both of these to be true. This applies to interns and execs equally; drop by Robert's office to see how true it is for yourself. The culture reinforces itself when you see how hard people work to build something awesome, it's really inspirational.

Flexible schedules. You're adults; if you can accomplish your work, you manage your own time (normal caveats apply, of course -- physical presence is still important, and there are only so many meeting times that will work for most people).

Sweet perks - Free catered lunches, on-site gym, free bootcamp/Crossfit classes (yoga will be returning as well), some health/exercise related partner discounts, ping-pong, arcade games, beer on tap.

Making a difference. Working here gives you an opportunity to positively affect people's lives across the workforce. Even better, it's universally applicable. Is there something that annoys you about work in general that you don't think needs to be that way? Here's a great place to start trying to work on that.

Good brand. People commonly not only recognize but actually like the company, which gives super positive vibes. (Obligatory shout out to the awesome PR team!)","The first 2 aren't really hard ""cons"" as much as reminders that this is a bustling tech company, not a haven of freeloaders enjoying overcompensation and perks: 1) Things move very fast, and change is constant. Employees must be able to keep up. 2) Crunch time is no joke. Engineers might see long hours on a per-project basis, and salesmembers see it with the seasonal business. Other departments likely have similar waxes. I questioned whether the finance team ever left the office for months (during times I was working 11-12 hour days, no less).

Bureaucracy is growing. As the company grows, so come more layers that slow everything down. This is exacerbated by new hires higher up on the food chain since they need to ramp on more things. Zero-to-market time on products has taken a hit.

MVP delusions. Many products are initially built as lightweight as possible, or the ""Minimum Viable Product"" with the intention of filling out later, but... never quite get filled out. This mindset hurts engineering as much as it hurts the product by encouraging hacky, non-reusable code.

A bit behind the tech curve. The product brainiacs (I don't mean that in a bad way; they're just smart) drive their roadmaps with gusto, leaving less time for engineering innovation and infrastructure. There have been some internal drives to address this, but there has been little  penetration."

Because Glassdoor is a relatively small company that collects a lot of data for jobs, salaries, and company reviews, there are a lot of problems to tackle, and a lot of flexibility in your approach to solving them. At the end of the day it feels pretty rewarding to know that your work can impact millions of Glassdoor users. I always felt appreciated by my managers for the work that I was doing while there as well. 

Glassdoor hires smart and friendly people. I really enjoyed my daily interactions with team members, and can honestly say that I learned something new from my manager or peers every week. I feel that the upper management is competent and is steering Glassdoor on a path to success. 

The mission of the company is noble and sincere - help people everywhere find a job they love. A lot of companies will just publish some corporate ""values"" or ""mission statements"", but I do feel Glassdoor is trying to empower people to make the best career decision they possibly can. 

Location - a lot of people complain that the location in Mill Valley is a negative, but if you live in the northern part of San Francisco, it can be a quick reverse commute. The office boasts serene views of Richardson Bay and Tiburon, and the free parking isn't bad either.","It's really frustrating being a Glassdoor stock/option holder right now. Glassdoor has one of the most restrictive shareholder agreements in the industry. Employees are not free to sell their shares on a private company exchange like EquityZen, nor has Glassdoor offered to buy back a portion of employees' stock (at least while I was there.) The executives claim that the reason for the restriction is so that all employees have some skin in the game, without acknowledging that it's very possible (and common) for employees to sell a portion of their shares AND have skin in the game.

-Strong mission","The review posted on July 7th really hits the nail on the head, as does the review on July 19th (except for the 4-star rating). I’ll try not to be too redundant.
 
The sales floor in Mill Valley is depressed. Truly. The energy that I felt when I first started is long gone. Since I’ve been here I’ve watched our book of business become significantly reduced, while quotas have gone up astronomically. Every month we are told “ this the most important month.” Every few weeks we get an ‘inspirational’ email from upper-management telling us how much the company needs us. These emails are as empty as our paychecks and becoming borderline comical. 
 
There is no career advancement. None. People who have been here for years have not seen a single increase in pay, which is already tragically low to begin with. I get it, we don’t promote on tenure. But, if it were purely on performance then some of your recent promotions didn’t make much sense either. (Those reps still absolutely deserved their promotions but let's not pretend it was actually based on some semi-enforced 'system’). A vast, disproportionate amount of our org promotions have been SDRs primarily to make up for our uptick in attrition.  

As for the cultural undertones at the office… Unfortunately for those of us at Mill Valley HQ it feels like the future is in Chicago. Day by day we watch as our friends and peers slowly dwindle away – either moving away or moving on. Management hasn’t explicitly said it, but come on, we aren’t stupid. We can see the open desks.

First, I truly believe in the mission of the company - ""help people make informed decisions about where they work."" Work is important - it's where many people spend the most time, your salary has a big impact on the freedom you have in your life, etc. So helping people make good decisions about their work is important and valuable.

Second, the work environment is great. People respect each other. Each person truly contributes to making the company successful. Management (which I'm part of) is extremely open about how decisions are made and what our goals are. And there is a great energy that comes from everyone working together to achieve a shared vision.

We respect the importance of having balance in your life. We work hard, but people can always take time off when they want/need to. Often times people work extra but it's because they are excited to deliver results rather than because it's required.

And, people are compensated fairly. We have good salaries, extremely generous equity package and great benefits...especially for a startup - what startup do you know that had a 401K in the first year it existed?","We're prone to many of the drawbacks of a startup. Career opportunity is limited - with a 11 person company, there isn't a lot of room for promotion and taking on more senior roles. However, that is balanced with the opportunity for every person to have total ownership of his/her work and to play many roles so it's a great place to learn and grow.

There's also risk in a startup. We're fortunate to have enough capital to build the business, but any startup is riskier than an established company."

We mean it when we say integrity is a core value. For example, we have one consistent standard to how we approve or reject reviews, regardless of whether an employer is a client or not. Internally, through EQ training and leadership culture, we emphasize open communication and feedback.

There are many smart people in the tech industry, but the people here are also generally the most caring co-workers I’ve had, and I think it’s related to our product and mission. Also, I love working with the data science team, and hope that we will remain friends beyond our time at Glassdoor.

I’m a big fan of the CEO’s decision to focus more this year, and I’m optimistic about the strategy. I also like the recent attention to listening to and understanding our users. In the past it had felt like users were mainly traffic numbers.

Work-life balance is respected. We have options for work from home and flexible hours. Some people work nights and weekends, but often this is self-driven.

We still have much upside to incorporating data science into more of our product, especially since we have so much data to work with.","There have been several re-orgs in the Data Science & Analytics teams - the most recent one splits us into Decision Science and Machine Learning groups. Re-orgs are probably common for a growing company our small size, but it takes some adjustment, e.g. how our career paths here change with them.

Though he will still work with us, the VP of Data Science is leaving data science to lead product and strategy here. This is a big win for the company, but a loss for our team. He has been a big force in mentoring and inspiration, working closely with us from whiteboarding ideas and formulas to providing feedback on even our detailed work.

Some departments are more title inflated and heirarchical, and information can be lost in communication across layers or across teams, causing people working on the ground to hear about them late and feel like they have little say.

We are in the early stages of using big data processing technology in data science, and still figuring this out."

Great cultural leader - the CEO sets the tone of working hard, humbleness, listening to all points of view, and solving problems together. He's created a very special company. 

Exciting business - we're disrupting and making the world a better place everyday - it's a mission that everyone at the company deeply cares about. 

Flexibility - everyone works hard, but there's a lot of tolerance for getting your work done on your own schedule, working outside of office hours, etc. 

Strong Consumer and B2B businesses - great leadership and employees have made this company successful. 

Strong performance - continuous performance above target in most areas makes riding on this train extremely gratifying. 

Scrappy teams that ""find a way"" to get it done.","Despite all the amazing ""pros"", several fairly serious challenges have developed recently due to company's roots and massive growth year over year that need to be addressed. This is a very detailed list, because I care. I love this company and I want it to continue to be great. I would like our leadership to tackle these problems: 

1. We work in a two-sided marketplace, and unfortunately, there's a big divide between the teams as well. The company originated on the consumer side, and most of the founders and people able to influence strategy and product innovation place the priority on the consumer side of the business. This makes it challenging to get resources and product improvements to improve the employer experience with our product. 

2. It's sometimes unclear how and why product decisions get made, and although people can freely give their input to the product team, it's unclear how the work is prioritized, when things will be delivered, etc. It feels like the product roadmap should be born from a clear company and product strategy, but it feels like a handful of people are making the decisions based on their opinions, with lack of serious consideration of input from internal or external customers. Some of this may be due to a lack of product or engineering resources - but it's definitely a struggle to get engineering resources on anything outside of what product leaders have planned, which is causing us to ignore many innovative ideas with high revenue potential. 

3. We're unfortunately developing a culture where you have to work hard to get resources because so many resources are cross-functional. The cross functional resources aren't working, because individuals make decisions on what they are going to work on rather than those decisions being made based on a clear strategy from the top. 

4. We need to drink our own champagne when it comes to our culture. In the time I've been at the company, there's been little mention of our culture. We have amazing values stemming from our CEO,  but we need to take advantage of those and get everyone on board - especially some of our top leaders who aren't always behaving in ways that align with the core cultural values that Robert believes in for the company. 

5. Our strategy from the top is very detailed on the consumer side, but it often feels like our employer business strategy is a line item. I'd like to see everyone in senior management put as much thought into the employer strategy and take the initiative to get to know that business and its customers much better. 

6. When entering new businesses or launching new products, we often don't put the strategic horsepower, resources, or dollars behind them. High expectations are set for revenue without the supporting resources or plan, creating a situation where it's difficult to deliver and teams continuously feel like their failing until the product is developed to the point where it provides true value.

empReview_11443487,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW11443487.htm,CS team is in shambles,2.0," Customer Success Managerin Mill Valley, CA","Aug 3, 2016",The people in the CS org are amazing. Really good people who you will love working with. Benefits are good too. The intention of Glassdoor is also good. What we do as a job as a CSM is also rewarding and fun. I love helping a client understand they value they are getting from our product. I know the value I bring to the table with my clients every single day. It's too bad that no one outside of CS realizes this value.,"I don't even know where to begin. There is so much that is wrong right now in CS. We have a fairly new VP who has come in and done her best to restructure, to make this team strategic, but there is only so much one person can do when the CEO doesn't see value in the team she was hired to lead. I'm not even sure he sees value in the overall CSM function (because he doesn't understand it), but I think he knows enough to know what we had before wasn't working which is why he hired her, but things have just gotten worse. I had hoped they would get better with an experienced executive in the mix. 

The perceived lack of value is something that stems from CEO to all other areas of the company, and impacts us because Sales sees us as nothing more than simple robots who should be running jobs campaigns perfectly. The reality is that we have too many clients to run all of the campaigns effectively, especially when things outside of running campaigns keep falling on our plates. They really pile things on the CS team.. it is all designed to take things off Sales's plate, but the crazy thing is that Account Managers continue to do the CSM job and don't to what it is they need to do, which is dig into accounts and expand relationships and dollars.

Sales leadership sees us as little more than glorified admins - thus sales treats us as such, and we feel demoralized and totally undervalued. Our AM counterparts push the admin stuff of the job onto us, but won't let go of the strategic stuff that we're now supposed to be doing. They aren't hitting their quotas (as you can see in all of these other reviews) but if the Account Managers would stop doing CSM work and focus on selling and expanding their existing client base, they might actually do that. But Sales Leadership doesn't trust the CSM team to be strategic and handle the day to day for the accounts, and the sales reps certainly don't. 

The best example I can give is the Sales Alerts that go out. These are the most demeaning thing to me and the rest of the CSM team. We are barely mentioned other than to indicate who the CSM on the account is .. and it's not always that we deserve a mention, but even when we did something, it's barely recognized when the manager sends it out. Even worse, when others reply all to this email, it's always ""great job Account Manager"", never, ""good job TEAM"", or anything to mention that the AM couldn't have done it with out the CSM. Something that is supposed to be a celebration of success - OUR success as a team - ends up demoralizing and showing me that I am not valued over and over and over again. It's insulting and I don't even look at the alerts anymore because I don't want to feel like that anymore. 

Because of this lack of perceived value, we are all underpaid. This is a Glassdoor theme though, as we aren't known for paying top dollar. The equity is supposed to balance that, but no one on the CS team has enough equity to mean anything. Again, we aren't valued. We are supposed to be taking more and more things off of Sale's plate so that they can achieve their sales goals - but we aren't compensated for this. We have quotas, but the amount of money we are paid in comparison to the AM team is borderline insulting. CS at Glassdoor is thought of as a cost center, not as a function that both saves & brings in revenue, and this is felt by our team daily. 

People in the CS org are leaving left and right, people who have been through all of it and people who have built it. They're gone. Morale is so low right now and I don't like coming to work anymore. I am not alone. What keeps me coming back is the company mission and the people I work with, those that I'm in the trenches with, I want to see it work with them. I want this to turn around at Glassdoor."

To be quite frank there aren't a lot of cons. 

Except one...

Glassdoor is a fast growing company and it has growing pains. Often times these pains can be swept aside and easily masked behind a wave of positive attributes. Things are changing. Glassdoor has always been known for underpaying its reps. The carrot that has kept everyone working is vested interest in the company. The company is reaching a point where they are asking too much of their reps without showing good faith in return. Upper management and most likely the board want to squeeze every last possible dollar out of its sales team while paying them significantly less than market value. 

If you look at a lot of reps they aren't even mad at the recent slash in comp plans. They are defeated! Many live and breathe Glassdoor and are huge contributors to reaching lofty sales org goals. Only to see that hard work used against them in the following years comp and quota plans.  

Slashing an already underpaid sales team with no warning is not what Glassdoor represents. We are different than other companies in so many ways. Why do we forget transparency when it comes to the most important reason we all work in the first place? 

The majority of these reps will not make it big when the company decides to go public. We will still be working extremely hard to make this company successful and reach all of its goals. 

Large changes like this come from the top. Can Glassdoor really afford to loose it's top talent right now?"

The company is young, energetic and has a good sense of camaraderie.","The stock option plan has several significant flaws that make the stock riskier than other startups. Most employees aren't aware of these flaws. The CEO has been aware of these issues for years and has not done anything about it. In fact he has done one thing to make it even riskier. He has failed the employees in this area.

Glassdoor rejected the first version of this review because I was specific about the ways it is riskier and leads to more tax for employees and exiting employees. So, to get this version approved, I am going to have to be more vague and leave it in the hands of the current employees to investigate and resolve with the CEO.

Without specifically saying what Glassdoor plan has or doesn't have...Theoretically, here is what a good stock option plan puts in place for its employees:

1) a way to avoid paying tax when option holders exercise stock. The way to do this is typically by putting an 83b program in place so employees can early exercise their stock when it's fair market value is the same as their grant price. If an 83b doesn't exist, employees can only exercise when they vest and it is likely that the 409a value has increased and the employee would have to immediately pay tax on the ""paper gain"". This puts the employee in the situation where they have to pay taxes and they actually can't sell the stock to help pay the taxes.

2) a way to get the clock started on the holding period required to pay the capital gains tax rate instead of the ordinary income rate when a liquidity event happens. This can amount to a large savings (i.e. 30%-50%) which is real money. This is also typically done via an 83b program. And...this is INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR MULTIPLE YEARS, An 83b program is one of the ways to enable employees to get the clock started on the 5 year holding period required for QSBS exemption which can mean that NO CAPITAL GAINS taxes are paid. This can be a HUGE savings for employees when there is an IPO or acquisition.

3) the ability to sell vested shares when the employee has a financial need. With many startup staying private for 10 years before a liquidity event...it is likely that employees will have financial needs during that period - everything from wanting to put a down payment on a house to paying for kids' schools, a wedding, or elder care. When a company is still private, the way they can enable employees to meet their financial needs is to not place ""transfer restrictions"" on the stock. This allows employees to use sites like equityzen and Sharespost to sell their stock to a third party buyer. 

If you look on EquityZen's website...you'll see that many bay area tech company employees' are able to sell their shares on the secondary market."

- Work/Life balance: Able to leave at a decent hour and not expect a flood of emails in the evening or over weekends 
- Ability to grow professionally: management cares about fostering your talent and giving you opportunities to network, test/expand your skills, increase your responsibilities 
- Working cross-functionally: high likelihood to work with various teams and departments, rather than being siloed 
- On-boarding experience: thoughtful coaching, buddy system, well-paced training materials for sales and marketing staff 
- Visibility and transparency: Upper management is open about their plans/goals/initiatives, and regularly shares feedback and answers questions in bi-weekly company-wide huddles 
- Company events/socials: Fun company happy hours, team lunches, holiday parties, great company spirit - Wellness: Free food every day and fitness classes offered, great gym 
- Pay and equity: competitive pay and wonderful equity package for all employees 
- Dog-friendly policy: such a great way to boost morale and liven up the workplace 
- Quality of leaders/managers: thoughtful and careful selection of our leaders pays off, each executive team leader is respectable, highly motivating and effective at moving the organization forward
- Great internship program and community involvement (e.g. Gratitude Lunch and Engineering After School program)","- Reign in your egos, middle-management: Despite everyone having equity in the company and boasting the ""people first"" motto, many middle-management leaders/directors posses and exhibit some serious egos. Rather than being collaborative, they have a tendency to shut down ideas, speak dismissively.  
- Exec managements limited understanding of B2B sales/marketing: As a marketing team member, it feels as though we are constantly fighting a battle to prove our worth and justify our spend. While, yes, marketing is responsible to generating pipe/bookings, there are countless other impacts that are immeasurable. 
- Not enough engineering support for marketing: Making a minor update to a website should not take over a month. Need to be able to advantageously explore digital marketing opportunities without waiting months for the next open sprint.
- Avoiding personnel issues: We promote being a culture that is humble and not arrogant, respectful and not mean, but there are some employees who receive multiple warnings about being rude, dismissive, arrogant and mean, but still remain employed and/or just get shifted to another role. I'm not sure if skating around the issue is the best way to foster these values. 
- Too many presentations - QBR, Monthly Reviews, ""How Marketing Works"" impromptu decks - the list goes on. 
- Lack of or always-shifting product roadmap
- Chasing a moving target - Delayed forecasts and sales models creates inefficiencies, unnecessary worry/concern"

Why is it amazing? I am constantly reminded that I'm working towards our mission. We are helping people everywhere find the jobs and companies that they love. That means we're helping some negotiate their salaries - even the last $1 for an hour! That makes a huge difference in the lives of people. We are helping them master the interview process, and land their dream job. The reviews genuinely help people make a GOOD choices, and help companies make GOOD choices internally so they can always improve. I'm inspired by this everyday.

Other than the mission, I believe the leaders are so strong. Robert inspires me every time I hear him talk. He's also very approachable at every level of the company. I've seen a sales rep talk to him in the lunch room about changing a small feature on our website - the next day, the problem is solved!

I also think that our sales team and leaders are steeped in GRIT, and that is inspiring. I think that their are always going to be ups and downs in start-ups, change is the only constant, it will always be a roller coaster. But I am happy to be on this roller coaster with such fun and hardworking colleagues. I am always inspired by people who punch above their weight class and take on tasks far outside of their job description to help improve the company. 

From a woman's perspective; I've had two babies while being employed by Glassdoor, and I am so thankful by how supportive Glassdoor was for both. I was welcomed back to work after 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, and I was excited to be back. It's also nice to know that they really try to hire a lot of strong female leaders across the org.","I don't think any company can say that they are perfect, and we have all made our fair share of mistakes. I think Glassdoor tries to learn quickly from their mistakes and pivot or change as needed.

We have hired so many smart and gung-ho people in the last year that it has been hard to get everyone up to speed quickly which I would say has caused some ""growing pains"". But I think we are now set up well to scale. 

I also think we could do a better job of creating career paths within certain roles across the org to ensure that we are striving to improve ourselves, and hang on to our best people. For example, creating salary bands, bumps, etc - especially for sales."

The old models from indeed and monster are going away and Glassdoor will be the first to connect job seekers and companies based on a deeper, more emotional level than just matching skills. Being a part of the team and seeing the value that we are delivering to clients is fun and it's only just starting to catch on. Glassdoor has owned the user-generated content regarding employers for a long time, and once we solidify our spot as the one-stop-shop for job seekers to learn not just about companies, but also find new opportunities, the sky will be the limit and the old job boards will just be trying to catch up.","The only cons I can think of are typical of an organization that is growing like crazy and figuring out how best to monetize their products and audience.

Broken processes, not enough heads in key areas (engineering and ops - wow the slow turnaround and backup is crazy), segmented departments or strange reporting organization/hierarchies that need restructuring. But none of this is uncommon at companies at this stage. Glassdoor, and our department, suffers at times from a very junior workforce that is not appreciative of what's before them. Lower morale seen in some recent reviews may be due to changes or restructuring that feels unfair, but part of me feels like you can't get better than Glassdoor in terms of a management team that's trying. Compensation for some positions feels a little low. Meetings, to our own fault really, are out of control. Booked over lunch usually. Maybe there's just too much to do.

Great existing product that works really well, and some of the best people you'll ever work with.","Glassdoor is in the critical stages of post-startup mode.  The acquisition by Recruit Holdings was supposed to provide the financial backing and fuel needed to accelerate the already high growth the company was experiencing.  Instead it's left the organization in a sea of turnover (particularly in leadership) and left boots on the ground employees with far more questions than answers.  For a company who's entire existence is centered around employer transparency, internal communications are impressively opaque.  Changes continue to be communicated last minute and fundamental business issues go months without any updates from leadership.  As someone on the sales team, the 4 departments that support sales efforts (being Marketing, Product, Sales Operations, and Sales Enablement) are all woefully incompetent and mismanaged.  Marketing has no idea how to string together grammatically correct sentences, let alone educate employers on our unique value proposition.  Product has finally pushed forward 1 meaningful update to the solution that we can sell, the first in the nearly 19 months I worked here.  I legitimately have no idea what they do all day.  Sales Operations is constantly understaffed and stuck under inefficient manual processes that keep them constantly behind on their caseload while basic pieces of our Salesforce instance fail to work properly.  Sales Enablement is either spending their time running trainings that are either totally redundant or of little value, or they are doing seemingly nothing at all.  We went more than 9 months as a team without a single training run by Enablement until they were finally able to scrape together enough budget to bring in an outside sales trainer for 1 day.

Meanwhile, the company is struggling to maintain sales volume and seems to have no answer to this problem.  Most managers are still running 1 on 1 meetings with their direct reports that have little substance.  Very little is going on in terms of coaching and development, just a lot of people relying on the same old strategies that no longer work.  As a result, a lot of their best employees have left the company for greener pastures."

Lunch is provided everyday, snacks, small gym, yoga and Crossfit classes.",This company does not represent its product. The working environment is one of the most toxic I have ever experienced. HR violations are abound and most do not report due to the fear based culture. Higher up managers are known for extremely inappropriate acts and it is astonishing how it is accepted. There are GOOD people at Glassdoor who work extremely hard and their only reward is to be told they arent working hard enough. Emotional deflation is  common. After leaving Glassdoor and joining another company I couldn't believe the difference. Being in a positive environment where you are supported and not afraid is incredible. My hope is that others escape Glassdoor and find bliss elsewhere.
empReview_2552593,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW2552593.htm,Senior Account Executive,5.0," Senior Account Executivein Sausalito, CA","Apr 11, 2013","So far my experience with Glassdoor has lived up to and even exceeded my expectations.  First I would like to review the culture.  I love to come to work everyday.  It is a culture that treats you like an adult.  They expect you to come in and work hard because being a newer company we can have a direct impact on Glassdoor moving forward.  But is very relaxed atmosphere as well.   A break room with tons of food to snack on and breakfast is provided daily.  Also there is a grill outside so you can bring in your own food and get to grilling for lunch.  There is a lot of room for professional development and growth.  Glassdoor provides a lot of transparency in the company, which is important because  that is what we do for our career community.  There is an open door policy where you can walk into any of the execs office and talk with them about pretty much anything.  I also like that the company is really cohesive and there is a lot of collaboration across many departments.  Everybody wants to see the company grow and become a market leader.  There are no egos here which can be a problem with many start up companies.  I would say Glassdoor has already been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my professional career.  I can not wait to spend the rest of my career with this company.","With any newer company there are going to be processes and strategies that need to be figured out.  But those pitfalls are already being addressed which just takes time and collaborate efforts among executives, directors, managers and employees.  The company is doing a great job of taking feed back from employees and implementing it as needed."
empReview_9499621,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW9499621.htm,Small Company Punches Above Its Weight,5.0," Chief Economist and Senior Directorin Mill Valley, CA","Feb 8, 2016","Glassdoor is a rare combination of a private company doing something that really improves the lives of ordinary workers -- bringing transparency to pay, job interviews, and workplace culture -- and doing it in a huge way around the world. It's like working at ""we're saving the world"" nonprofit, but with private sector pay and benefits. 

As the company has grown over the past year or so, they have done a great job of preserving the quirky, small, tech-company culture. It has gotten bigger and more professional over the past year, but still feels scrappy and with a lot of interesting personality. 

People here seem happy with their jobs. There is a lot of talent here, but not a lot of huge egos. Glassdoor has a very flat organization, with little of the annoying, exclusionary hierarchy you see in larger firms. Everyone has a desk in the bullpen, and people roll up their sleeves and do their own work. I like that. 

It is fun working for a place with such a positive public image. Who doesn't love Glassdoor? 

Working from home is a possibility, at least for many employees. There is really generous vacation and leave policy. The company treats people like adults -- you take time off when you need it. 

The CEO is someone I liked instantly at my first job interview, and is someone I really believe in personally. The real unicorn in the building is him, and the amazing people he has surrounded himself with. I have learned a tremendous amount just watching him run the company this past year, and feel lucky to have been part of this amazing organization. 

I was made a lot of promises when I came on board, and I'm happy to report that essentially all of them were kept. I was basically given the ability to create a new division inside the company, with lots of room for my own creativity and personality. This hands-off approach is essential for a culture of entrepreneurship, and Glassdoor definitely keeps that torch alive.","The Mill Valley location is beautiful -- nice view, video games, awesome workspaces. But seriously, for anyone who ever wants to own a home or raise a family (who isn't already a tech millionaire) this is the worst possible location for a company. Many people are doing huge commutes in from places that are more affordable. This is a major problem Glassdoor needs to solve as it grows -- the should get closer to mass transit, or get closer to cheaper real estate. I believe this will hurt the company's recruiting long-term if not solved. 

If you're not working within a large group inside the company, it is easy to get stuck working alone with no peer group. This is not something specific to Glassdoor -- it's a problem at all small employers that often have a single person doing some business function. Working mostly alone makes it hard to grow professionally, can lead to stagnating skills, and makes it hard to do the kind of creative brainstorming needed for real innovation."

That creates huge opportunities so long as you perform up to, or above, expectations.

Team: the talent varies based on the team, but I'm excited to be working with a group of rockstars, and think the talent level in general is pretty impressive. 

Management: so good, so approachable, so honest, so transparent. I've never worked at a place where execs for the most part are willing to listen to the team, admit their mistakes, and be completely honest about why they're making the decisions they are. 

Benefits: fully paid medical premiums? check. Fantastic lunch every day? double check. Getting to work on the water in sunny Marin? yeah I'll take that too

Work/life balance: this can cut both ways, as some people take advantage of it, but this is a place where you can have a life outside of work. Varies by team, but for the most part the office clears out at a reasonable hour and I assume that it's empty on the weekends since I've never been in the office to take count.","Growing pains: We're trying to grow up as a company. That can be painful. Not everyone is going to be thrilled with the decisions management has made, and some of the harder ones probably weren't communicated as well as they could have been.

Moving quickly: For being the size that we are, decision-making can be really startup-ey. We aren't a tiny startup any more, and need to realize that things are going to move a bit more slowly than they used to. Otherwise things will break.

Clearly it's working for me.  The management is some of the best I've worked with, and I've worked in tech for quite a long time.  They're not just great at what they do, either.  They're genuinely fun people.

I consider myself a code artist.  (I'm not nearly as douchey as that sounds.)  I find that Glassdoor continues to maintain my interest with the challenges of developing the site.  I'm continuously learning new things, which makes me very happy.

The office environment is for the most part an open floor plan.  No soul-deadening cubicles, just a bunch of desks.  As a web developer, I'm face-to-face with our designer, which works very well.  People can simply turn around and ask questions of other team members.  It's a very interactive environment, and I like that.  The folks who have chattier jobs, like Business Development, our lawyer, and the head of marketing all have private offices, which also works well.  We don't have to listen to them talking on the phone all day.

The office kitchen is heavily stocked with an assortment of soft drinks, unhealthy snacks, and fresh fruit.  There is also beer and wine on Friday afternoons and with the occasional barbecue on our expansive deck.  Employees take turns playing disk jockey on the office stereo.  The office has an entire wall of windows looking out onto the Sausalito hills.  And the water is only a block away.  Overall, the office lifestyle is pretty darned good.","The downside of constantly being challenged is that I'm usually exhausted at the end of the day.  If I have a social event right after work, it takes me about an hour to recover from my 'code coma' and be able to make decent conversation.

Our site needs to work on Internet Explorer.  Any web developer will read that and start shaking their heads in sympathy.  Everyone else should just stop using IE and switch to Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.  Please?  You'll be glad you did.

The pay is on the low side, but there are the stock options, which hopefully will hugely make amends for that some day.  Still, it would be nice to make a little more money.  Every engineer knows that nice vacations and the latest electronic gadgets are a great cure for burn-out. :-)

Though the company is fairly relaxed about vacation time, the 'official' 2 weeks seems pretty minimal.   (Full disclosure: I believe we should get 4-6 weeks vacation, like the more-civilized Europeans.  But I'm not sure that would work in a start-up environment.)"

As you can see in just about every recent review, yes the road is bumpy right now. But, I do genuinely believe management and leadership is fighting to make it right. It's hard to see GD as a start-up but we are still adapting to this hyper growth and I'm trying to be patient with management as they pave the road ahead. 

There are some absolutely amazing leaders and mentors here at Glassdoor.

Because we're Glassdoor, cultural transparency is king. However, when it comes to logistical and operational transparency that's where things get grey and where honestly, I don't think there is any. 

Communication continues to be a roadblock. Changes will happen and teams will have to wait weeks to find out really critical information like who their manager will be and what accounts will land in their name for the next quarter. It's hard to charge ahead with confidence when you feel like you're being left in the dark with little consideration form leadership."

A lot of information is shared in weekly all hands meetings, and employees do have a good idea of where the company is heading, the challenges ahead, why they make certain decisions (like funding rounds), etc. 

It is definitely a high-potential company. Glassdoor is not going away and an IPO is inevitable. So probably a decent upside for those who stick around. And of course the perks are fantastic.

This is especially true in the product and marketing organizations. It is always hard for founders or early employees to make room as the company grows and to cede control. The shift from being a scrappy startup to a well-oiled growth engine with good processes/practices is not an easy one, but the change needs to be made. For this to happen, senior leaders need to move away from being very hands-on and driving every decision top-down to empowering their employees, trusting them to do the right things and encouraging constructive discussions/arguments. As a product leader especially, you cannot keep throwing terms like ""let's be scrappy"" when you should be driving sound practices through the product org that encourages good long-term planning, roadmapping process, socializing with stake holders, running experiments, etc. And when product managers feel like they do not have clear ownership and are mere foot soldiers when decisions are top down, then they will struggle to excel at their jobs. They will be left to defend ideas with various stake holders that are not their own and that they don't necessarily even believe in."

The pros of working at Glassdoor start with the people who make up the company. I made some of my best friends here and became a part of the big family. Sounds cliche but we were bonded under a strong vision and belief in bettering peoples lives through transparency. 
Robert was and still is an amazingly inspirational leader. It's hard to find that type of leader and it's certainly not at any old start up out here in the Bay. I feel lucky to have followed Robert for close to three years during our high growth phase.
Autonomy and a value on work-life balance. We really walked the walk at GD with regards to letting people work how they wanted to just as long as they were getting their job done. I valued the unlimited PTO policy when we still had it.
A brand and belief that is fundamentally changing the way companies treat and engage with their employees. It's really cool to feel a part of something bigger, and in my own small way as an SDR and then an AE I got to contribute to helping spread our mission and change the HR landscape. This isn't something you come across at every company. And it's a big deal and a reason GD enjoys such loyal employees who ""bleed green"" and run through brick walls for their company.","I've struggled with writing this review for 6 months now. I wanted my feedback to be balanced and when I left I had felt a lot of anger that has now subsided. I've been through quite a bit during my almost 3 yrs with Glassdoor and have seen the company change from a crazy fast growth start up to a bigger, more corporate machine.
Some cons that eventually added up to me departing (and it wasn't an easy choice):
1) Not being set up for success in sales. I had a particularly rough go of it with a particularly bad territory but managed to hold on until we flattened it (that helped a lot and all the reps who had territories outside of the Bay Area or NYC started hitting quota). I want to make clear that flattening the territories isn't something every company does and I have a ton of admiration for Robert and our sales leadership at the time for their ownership and accountability in fixing the problem.  Unfortunately more problems persisted along side and afterwards.
2) Constant moving targets. Some of this is to be expected as we are in a fast growth company who in a lot of ways is ""still figuring it out."" The target as of now is hitting an AE2 quota for 1 year before  you can become an AE2. Then, you aren't given any actually better accounts or tools to hit your higher quota. What resulted was a bunch of burnt out AEs who get to AE2 and then falter. The AEs who were able to only sit as an AE2 for one quarter were able to mitigate this effect (commonly referred to by all AEs) known as the ""AE2 curse."" Might be due to point #3. 
3) Crazy rampant politics amongst middle management. Unfortunately there's a couple offenders who treat some of their reps worse than others simply because they didn't suck up to them as much as they would like. We haven't been operating as a meritocracy like we claim to be. It's created a very toxic culture and bred resentment amongst the reps who weren't ""favorites."" 
4) Managers are ineffective. This was the final straw for me. I stayed through everything listed above because I had a manager that genuinely cared about my success and happiness. Once I was placed under a new manager it wore down my self-esteem, self-worth, and made my one-on-ones a constant chess match of who could ""win"" the argument. I no longer had anyone in my corner, in fact, after constant threats and snarky remarks it felt like I had an enemy."

You will see time and time again that the people that work for this company are absolutely amazing.  The office location can sometimes have you stranded due to flooding but almost always it is sunnier than the city.  Lunch every day was delicious and it was also helpful to have the gym to workout whenever you wanted.,"The Company

I feel like Glassdoor hasn't quite defined what they want to do yet. Do they want to focus on branding? Do they want to focus on Jobs? Do they want to focus on Salaries/Data? When I was there I wasn't quite sure what the play was, and I think the company is currently struggling with the same questions.  How the product is sold also poses as a risk for the company. Sales people have to sell the vision of Glassdoor using mashed up ROIs in order to get Marketing/HR/Recruiting to invest. I think this is why the sales/cs team is such a large portion of the company (about 1/3 last time I was there) and I think there needs to be some creative thinking as I don't see the large proportion of sales as scalable.

Leadership

I think Sales Leadership is lacking.  Glassdoor is not ready to become a public company if the leaders of the sales org cannot carry a number they signed off on. Leadership consistently ""signs off"" on decisions and then doubles back on this and says they never signed off or were pressured to do so, you will hear every excuse in the book instead of them owning it. This type of leadership unfortunately has percolated to the bottom, where now Sales Reps and Sales Managers think it is okay to do this when they aren't hitting their numbers as well, this is why quotas changed 5+ times during my time there. The culture has turned into the blame game versus grit. Let's be honest, at most Saas companies in the bay area  30-40% of the sales org hits their quotas. 

HR/Promotion Cycle
Glassdoor has a tight budget, don't expect to get promoted even if recruiting tells you that during your calls with them. I had 3 managers during my time and unfortunately this meant I didn't have anyone fighting to get me the salary I deserved. Don't expect anything to be given to you even if you do amazing work."

empReview_14514328,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW14514328.htm,Left with mixed feelings,3.0," Senior Software Engineerin Mill Valley, CA","Apr 6, 2017","- Glassdoor is a good place to work. They have their issues but the important thing is the senior leadership (CEO) is very open and willing to change the direction of the product/company if it comes to that. Robert's office is always open and you can ask him questions (anonymously, if you prefer) during company huddles.

- Nothing is set on stone - things could change. Glassdoor as a company improves upon their product tremendously. They run A/B tests and are willing to pivot their product direction if necessary. I believe that's very important for a growing company to succeed. 

- Coworkers. They are all amazing bunch of people. I have made some good friends while working there. 

-  Company offers tons of perks - gym with shower, lunch, snacks, $50 mobile phone bill credit, game room, free or close to free health insurance etc.

- Dog friendly.","- When I first joined Glassdoor it was the best company I ever worked for. The team was small and we were moving fast but without compromising in quality (i.e by shifting the deadline by a day or two if the product wasn't quite ready). As the company grew, stories became open ended and deadlines became almost impossible to shift which forced us to compromise in quality. There were at least three instances I could recall in the past year where we were given a hard deadline but without ironing out the details of the story or having final designs. In all three of those cases, we either didn't end up using that product or shifted the deadline so we could roll it out all together with rest of the teams.

- Most of us are underpaid. This became clear when we launched Know Your Worth Tool. A former colleague of mine who left Glassdoor had told me about the 30% salary increase he/she got at their new place. 

- My new manager was micromanaging the team. He/she always wanted to know what we were working on (even though he/she was there for the daily standup). My manager would listen in to our conversation with fellow colleagues and provide unsolicited opinion."

Like any other organization you need to play your cards well and build the right reputation and relationships to speed up your promotion track, but overall, movements do happen frequently.

Great benefits & work life balance: Free catered lunch (amazing), dog friendly office (it helps owners and other employees to feel emotionally supported with so many cute dogs in our teams), 401K match (this took a few years but it's amazing that we have it now), very flexible PTO policy as long as you are performing on your numbers, awesome health/dental policies and an ok working from home policy. 

Office location: This is tough for people that live in the city or if they don't have a car to drive to the office, but being right on the water in the Marin county has elevated the company culture and it's refreshing to work in this beautiful ""suburb"" only 4 miles north of SF/Marina neighborhood. 

Lower Management: I have had 4 different managers here and every single one of them were amazing human beings, very empathetic, always supporting reps, passionate about our career and personal development and overall very hard working people that is extremely hard to find in the bay area  especially in Sales.","Upper management & executive team: Leadership is very removed from the needs and struggles of the lower end of the workforce - with the most recent news of Glassdoor HQ moving to the city, I was expecting a more reasonable announcement to get employees more excited and pumped about moving to SF. But, because they are so disconnected with what we need, it was a very disappointing announcement in our monthly all-hands meeting and actually quiet insulting. Yes, we all understand that moving to the city is more beneficial to attract new talent and grow our company. However, just being located in the city doesn't get Glassdoor the ""top talent"" we are looking for - it certainly makes it easier but if we are not considering a competitive perks & benefits package in addition to our ""hot new office in the city"" this will only get us the average candidate that can't get hired at other hot companies/startups in the city. 

This is not the first time that upper management has made announcements without reasonable preparation or understanding of employees needs and concerns. In fact, during the all hands meeting, when we were raising our hands to share our concerns/ask questions, a few leaders were laughing at our comments and making it sound like we were ridiculous for surfacing these concerns which was both insulting and disappointing. Additionally, for a company that always preaches ""transparency"" and ""culture"" they didn't consider for once how people will react to these not very well presented announcements and made it very obvious that ultimately the decisions will be made regardless of the impacts they may have on people's lives and there is no room for review, hence why I am very disheartened by leadership and their decision making process. 

Priorities: If you are an engineer or a technical talent looking for a job at Glassdoor, this is the right time because literally that's all they care about - if you are in Sales or Customer success, think twice because we are not given the right resources or teams to help us success in our roles.

The thing I like most about working here is the fact that I believe in Glassdoor's mission and vision, and I know my co-workers do too. My colleagues are super smart and passionate, and it's infectious.

Located in beautiful, sunny Sausalito, I enjoy riding my bike to work, eating on our deck overlooking the Bay at lunch and taking free yoga classes outside. Work/life balance is good with flexible scheduling and ability to work from home when you want or need to. We have an unlimited vacation policy, and whenever I'm on vacation, I'm encouraged to actually be on vacation - no checking emails or working!

The benefits and perks are wonderful with free lunch daily (salads, sandwiches, soup, daily hot dishes), a beautiful gym with high-end equipment and locker room, game room, beer on tap, Philz coffee, kayaks, standing desks, dog friendly (shoutout to Ruby!), etc. We have good healthcare, vision, dental and commuter benefits (for people that take public transportation) as well. Salary, bonuses and stock options are fair.

It really is the best job I've ever had, and I enjoy coming to work every day.","The biggest downside of working at Glassdoor is the commute (if you live in SF or beyond).

That is when things started going downhill.  I was placed on a performance plan in January; however, the problem was that I was not informed this was a possibility after Q4 had wrapped.  Talk about being transparent.  Unlike other sales orgs, this ""plan"" was not designed to help me succeed.  In fact, it was the opposite.  AE quotas had not been determined.  So I was expected to hit a certain percentage of an undetermined goal.  Great.  And had less than 30 days to do so from the time I was placed on said plan.  Cool.  This was also my first time on plan.  Fantastic.  I fought to stay and asked for a fair shot at hitting quarterly quota, which still hadn't been determined at that time.  Adding to the sting: the deals I had up-sold (2-year deals vs. standard 1 year) were ignored.  Those deals would have prevented me from being on ""plan"" altogether.   After a lot of back and forth, a ""compromise"" was reached at the end of January that gave me until the end of February to hit quota, which was still unofficial and hand-written onto my plan contract.  I've been in sales for 5+ years.  Being on plan scares everyone.  But my biggest frustration was the lack of professionalism upper management showed. It was as if Glassdoor's focus on transparency no longer applied.  ""Don't tell anyone you're on this plan.""  
At that point, I laughed.  I could not understand how the same company, the company I loved to work for, could expect me to ""be ethical,"" ""do the right thing"" and ""help people find jobs and companies they love.  Are you kidding me? What a joke."

I am rarely provided direction or constructive criticism for how to improve my ideas. It is mostly about how I need to do a better job of making sure other's ideas and solutions are implemented. Ego often gets in the way of real collaboration and partnership.

I want to stay at Glassdoor because I think this is a great company, but I don't know how much longer I can work in this environment. I was hired into the company under the impression that I would be able to contribute significantly to the product and grow my career. As it stands currently, I am not growing and it is incredibly difficult to contribute and feel good about the work I am doing. It's unfortunate that the product team runs like this and it is actually contrary to the culture that the company professes to engender.

- The company is doing very well and is growing like crazy. 
- The commute is only about 20 minutes from San Francisco and there is plenty of parking. 
- Lots of valuable sales training. 
- Beautiful location","The sales territories at the SAE  level are horribly unbalanced. To put this into perspective, only two reps at the SAE tier hit their quota last year. TWO. Those two reps represented New York City and San Francisco. These are by far the best sales territories at Glassdoor, as they are not only densely populated areas, but there is a high level of competition for talent. There is also strong awareness of Glassdoor and Glassdoor employer solutions. While Glassdoor is rapidly growing, many employers, especially those in the middle of the country, have no idea who Glassdoor is, let alone how Glassdoor works with employers. Many employers simply know Glassdoor as, ""that place where people can complain about our company"". As a senior account executive representing these territories, that is a huge challenge. You are less of a senior account executive and more of a new market developer. Your meetings resemble more of a free webinar than a sales meeting. And when it comes time to make a proposal, good luck. Employers who just recently learned who you are and what you do are not likely to move-forward with a big dollar partnership. Most don't even have the budget for it. Get very used to hearing, ""maybe next year"". 

Now, to be ""fair and balanced"" as we say, leadership has FINALLY acknowledged the fact there is unbalance with territories, and at the beginning of this year, they did make a few adjustments. For many reps however, this was too little, too late. We were held to the exact same standards as reps with NYC and San Francisco, and many reps lost their jobs as a result of not hitting their numbers. This is really unfortunate because there are a TON of good sales professionals at Glassdoor. 

My advice: If you decide to accept a position as an ""SAE Hunter"", tell them that you want a fair and balanced territory - anything on the West Coast, or Northeast is good. Minnesota, Chicago, and Denver are also pretty good. If they try to give you exclusively accounts in the South or Mid-West, run far away. You will beat your head against the wall for as long as you can until they fire you for not hitting your numbers. I don't care how good of a sales rep you think you are, you will try hard and you will fail. 

A few other things to note: 

- The sales floor is incredibly loud and chaotic, especially with so many dogs in the office. Be prepared for this. Buy good headphone and use the conference rooms and phone booths. You don't want to jeopardize a good meeting because of this. 

- Take your vitamins. The sales floor is like working at a hospital. Someone is always sick which means that everyone is always sick. 

- The office is awesome, but it's super isolated. There isn't many places to get lunch or go to happy hour. Plus, running a quick errand is pretty much impossible. 

- Make sure you go outside. Too many days I would come-in in the mornings, and not go outside until after it was dark. This is bad for your mental and physical health. Sausalito is a beautiful area, so be sure and take a walk with a co-worker so you can complain about your territory or sales manager :)"
empReview_5909810,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW5909810.htm,Good and not-so-good place to work,3.0, Anonymous Employee,"Feb 12, 2015","Glassdoor is an amazing company - the values they hold and the things they do for both businesses and individuals are really something incredible.  You'll notice that people here truly believe in what we're working for and that makes for motivated, intelligent, and creative workers.  You'll find that on every level - C-suite, manager, or anyone else - that everyone loves what we do.  To find that passion is rare and something to truly hold onto.  

And of course with every tech company, we have amazing perks - catered lunch, snacks, work from home option, stock options, gym.","The biggest challenge here is middle management.  I understand that at such rapid growth at a relatively young tech company, we're bound to promote within - but this can be a huge huge problem if such an individual is not qualified to do so. Because we're filled with such talented and smart people, we tend to be a pretty competitive arena.  And while that's something that can be motivating for people, it can also cause middle management and new managers to always strive to compete with the people they're managing.  This isn't right and doesn't foster an environment where individuals can grow - manager and those under.  

We need a better promotion and HR review cycles/processes.  There are a lot of new managers being promoted that really shouldn't be - just because they excel at their job doesn't mean they're entitled to be a manager.  A good manager should be one that not only excels, but can connect, motivate, and encourage their team members - and do that wholeheartedly.  Some departments - like mine - are seeing managers push down those who have ideas, want more, or just want to know what's going on within the team for reasons that seem like they want to keep their status known. 

I love Glassdoor and what we stand for, but seeing my growth stunted by my own supervisor is making me question if we're losing sight of our culture. We pride ourselves in providing a safe environment for workers to have ideas, to be heard, and to learn - but if we allow individuals to become managers who DON'T truly uphold this value ... then we aren't practicing what we preach."

empReview_11437462,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW11437462.htm,Is it too late?,2.0," Salesin Mill Valley, CA","Aug 2, 2016","A lot of us came to Glassdoor because it provided a unique opportunity to be part of a growing company that would allow us to progress our career while being a part of a culture and mission that you couldn’t find elsewhere. Equity, free lunch/snacks, gym/wellness programs, dental/medical benefits, vacation policy when it included unlimited PTO, beer on tap, dogs in the office, office on the water & company events.

What has kept me at Glassdoor for several years are the people and the culture that we’ve built. I have made amazing friendships and am lucky to be surrounded by smart, driven people who are invested in the growth and believe in the mission of Glassdoor. Sandler/Jim Mitchell training we received last year showed me that Glassdoor was invested in the personal and professional growth of the sales team.","This last year at Glassdoor has changed drastically, we understand that with change comes growing pains. However, as we’ve done in the past, when will we course correct? We constantly hear from our leaders that they ‘hear us’ yet nothing has altered and unfortunately it’s too late. It feels as though it is more than just the sales team where morale is down based off of conversations with other departments. As mentioned in the previous reviews, the culture and morale is shot and a lot of us just feel like a number and underappreciated. It is nowhere near what it used to be.  Leadership changes in 2016 as well as a lack of communication and transparency has adversely affected the sales organization. Not only are we paid far less than any other startup in the Bay Area, quotas are so high, reps are in fear of being put on a plan. When roughly 10% of the team is hitting quota, which includes ramping reps, it takes a huge toll on morale and our personal and professional happiness. We all believe in Glassdoor and the culture has kept us here, but at some point if we aren’t making money and leadership continues to ‘hear us’ but makes zero change, what’s the point of caring anymore?  Reps across the tiers are looking & taking other jobs as we know we are valuable assets at any other organization. In addition, there is little room for growth at HQ and puzzling staff cuts that are never addressed create an optic of uncertainty."
empReview_12201700,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW12201700.htm,Glassdoor has changed,4.0, ,"Oct 5, 2016","Glassdoor is a great company, there are tons of perks if you're full time. Almost everyone is nice and friendly in the office. Although GD is getting big, it still has the crazy start-up feel. I believe that Glassdoor is a fun place to work and we're lucky to have such great perks and Robert as our CEO.
Perks:
-Unlimited PTO (if you qualify)
-Free yoga during lunch is great
-On-site gym
-Lunch
-Sweets, treats and soda
-Couches
-Nice people
-Dogs if you like them (I tend to find them distracting)
-Growing company","While everyone is nice, no one has time to help you. We're always being told ""X team doesn't have bandwidth"" and whole programs/projects suffer because of it. Earlier this month we were told to eliminate projects that include other teams because they probably won't get done. The Product and Marketing teams are always overwhelmed with increasing demands for product features and new leads.

There are a few people in every department that have changed. They went from nice and friendly to short and demanding. I suspect it's because their managers/directors are pushing higher numbers down their throats while offering no new tools to meet the demands. The pressure is building and people looking to leave. The marketing department has lost a few and in sales we're losing even more.

Demands and goals continue to increase but we're still stuck with the same product to sell/market. There have been a few improvements, but these are small features that can't justify the high increases in cost, regardless of what the pricing survey says. We're pushing our jobs platform, but it still doesn't deliver. 

I see people from the Marketing team go above and beyond to answer emails or take on tasks that are clearly not what they were hired to do. I understand we're a start-up, but at a certain point employees need clear career advancement and to specialize in certain skills. It's much better to do one thing right than be spread so thin you end up half-assing multiple projects. No one asks you if you're actually happy with what you're working on. There is no communication between Engineering, Product, Sales and CS.

The website needs major work and our customers need help. Customers consistently call in with issues with their profile and CS cleans up our semi-working jobs+features mess. The CS and Growth teams have written reviews explaining this already.

Since I started, Glassdoor has changed. Walk through any of the departments and you'll see it, people are stressed. Our growth is starting to slow down and management is having a conniption. Management recognized that there were mistakes made last quarter but in the same breath demanded we still meet the same goals. That was very disheartening. There is pressure on everyone to pull rabbits out of a hat.

Although the feedback might be harsh, I believe we will pull through. We're a strong and scrappy and we're much tougher than to let a few growing pains shut us down. We still bleed GD Green!"

The people in the Enterprise Sales & Customer Success department are some of the most genuine and fun coworkers I've ever had. 
There is also a lot of great knowledge sharing between peers, which makes work more enjoyable and  interesting. 

There are many pros to working here including: 
- managers that treat you like a real human - they really try to be good managers!
- a lot of autonomy to manage your book of business / client interactions 
- flexibility to work from home a few times per month 
- ability to work on projects outside of your immediate role that interest you 
- cute workplace events that happen at the office (eg. hot chocolate bar during the holidays, drag queen bingo during pride week, etc) and a great Workplace Experience team","The direction Glassdoor is taking seems unclear to me, and the lack of innovation is concerning. The product team does not listen to what the customers are asking for or excited about. 

It seems like directors and VPs are focused on reorganizing how the company works internally more than focusing on innovation. There are constant shifts in KPIs, org structure, and quotas that make everything seem arbitrary. This year, the CSM leadership changed the metric which 70% of our bonus is paid out on, and gave us no way of tracking our progress to reaching that quarterly goal! I appreciate change and trying new things, but it's really concerning when your pay is affected by changes that you can't track. 

With all the org changes come lots of internal meetings that managers are always stuck in. It seems like instead of being on the floor with the individual contributors, managers/ directors are constantly in strategy meetings. Besides team meetings and 1:1s, there is very little involvement/ personal connection between leadership and individual contributors. A lot of first time managers/ directors. 

Lastly, we use a data tool to create custom presentations for enterprise clients that barely works. Our systems are so out of date, that it takes 15 min - 2 hours to download a custom report for a client. This drains a lot of time, and creates frustration."

CEO is a great guy, really down to earth and passionate about our vision

Great people and coworkers. I've made lifelong friends in a short amount of time","1- New comp plan: I'm being told that I need to sell more, while getting less commission. So I basically have to work harder and get paid the same or less (VERY likely we will make less as the goals are lofty). We are regressing, not progressing. This is drastic even by industry standards 

The mid-level managers are going to bat for us and trying to make things fair and keep us happy. But we have no insight into these things and it's hard for us to keep believing that the team has their best interest out for us.  Is there a way to make us more involved in these conversations so we aren't blindsided?

When I'm told as an employee that I don't deserve an increase in pay because of a stellar performance last year and it's going to be harder for me to make the same amount of money. Soul crushing...you just took away all my sales mojo :( 

2. Unable to make decisions in a reasonable time:

Pricing needs fixing ASAP. I understand we are reviewing but this is urgent and has been going on since last year. There are so many layers of approvals that it's hurting us on the front lines. This also goes for territory shifts and changes. I can't tell you the number of times I've heard ""we are doing scoring"" What is the scoring? Can we see it? Everything is in a black box and we only hear about it on Friday afternoons (seriously, every comp plan, quota, territory email).  There is going to be fallout, don't be afraid to address it

3. Sales Ops:

They rule the roost and management has no authority over them whatsoever (seems that way). Aren't the sales team their internal customer? I'm not saying we need world class service, but clear communication, email responses, quotes that work and don't change things without telling us would be nice.

-Taken together, Glassdoor is the best place I have ever worked. The culture is friendly but very smart, without huge egos getting in the way of our mission. My team is like a family to me, and overall the culture is empathetic, collaborative, and positive. 

-As a startup, people at Glassdoor were attracted by our mission to help people find a job and company that they love. Although we have grown dramatically during my time here, our CEO has been a north star for our culture, preserving it despite turnover, setbacks, growth, and successes. 

-Overall, the acquisition of the company by Recruit Holdings was a net positive for employees. Many long-time employees were handsomely rewarded by their cashed out stock options. It was honorable of the company to continue to pay out options after the acquisition, and showed the CEO's respect for employees. 

-Little has changed in the company since the acquisition. There have been no layoffs, no major operational changes, and even a few efficiencies on the engineering side from better coordination with our sister companies. 

-There were substantial pay raises for most employees after the acquisition, which brought up pay to SF Bay Area market rates. My comp today is even or above most competitors for similar roles. 

-We have preserved our great benefits package despite our growth and maturity as an employer. We still offer unlimited vacation, free lunch (in Mill Valley at least) and pretty terrific health coverage. 

-People with families are encouraged to take time off, and work flexibly to make sure their home responsibilities are covered. People work hard, but there is not a ""spend 10 hours at your desk"" culture here -- people work from home, take meetings via Zoom, communicate via Slack, and get the same amount of work done while also creating space for home life. 

-The company HQ is moving to SF in Fall 2020 (finally) which will dramatically improve commutes for many employees and will help us with recruiting SF talent as well. Marin is beautiful, but there is a reason no other major tech players have offices here -- there is no commercial real estate, no one can afford to live in Marin except execs, there are fires + flooding + power outages in Marin regularly, and you are on an island far away from SF making casual networking impossible. It's time for Glassdoor to put on its big-boy pants and finally move into the city like a real company -- that's finally happening now.","-My impression of our Product and Engineering orgs after 5 years here is that they are fairly conservative and slow-moving. We are behind the curve technically in many areas, and our roadmaps move really slowly. I don't know what the solution is, but lack of innovation on product and engineering are a serious long-term problem we face. 

-We are a tiny player in our competitive space, and that's not changing much over time. That lack of rapid upward momentum in terms of our business is very different than in the early years here, and it's sometimes hard to stay motivated without big growth prospects in the future. My team is growing really slowly (if at all) and feels like treading water sometimes. 

-I think we are moving too slowly in moving our HQ into San Francisco. For too long our physical location has been unduly influenced (in my opinion) by where our executive team has chosen to buy homes. Most employees are in SF or East Bay, not Marin, and there is a huge disconnect between the personal interests of execs who would like a short commute and the majority of the talent base who bears the cost of long commutes, lack of quality public transit, and unaffordable real estate for us to be in Marin. If we want to be a real company, we need to act like one and move to where the talent is -- not where our exec team wants to have a pleasant lifestyle (and can afford to live). 

-Our data infrastructure is not great. This is a hard problem to solve, at least with current leadership on the relevant teams. But other tech companies have figured this out, and we could do better. Data is too slow, not well documented, not widely accessible, and hard for product managers and business decision makers to get access to."

SMB Org has slowly starting to dissolve those ones by one. Although a culturally progressive company, it's like Glassdoor is stuck in a strange managerial, technological and structural timewarp.

1) SMB Leadership- there have been many instances where leadership has failed to step up to provide solutions to problems that highly impact the business and our contributors. In addition to not owning up to mistakes or errors that negatively impacted these teams. Underqualified Managers, questionable behaving Directors and an extreme trend of protected nepotism that is discouraging. I have quickly lost faith in Leaderships' ability to move Sales and Customer Success in a direction that more sustainable for clients and colleagues. Lacking grit, lacking innovation, lacking leadership qualities all in all, smooth talkers deflectors and reframers, unchanged Glint Feedback year after year with regular over-promised and underdelivers. 

2) HR- is underqualified and ill-equipped to handle difficult conversations and or make difficult decisions. There have been multiple potential legal situations that have been mishandled or miscommunicated. I question their ability to cultivate an obtain psychological safety.

3) FLUFF- there is a lot of caution around communication and tone. There is also a lot of unmeaningful dialogue that occurs frequently that prevent projects from getting done and initiatives or decisions being made. Too many opinions and to much input is sought and given to be decisive and efficient in a timely manner.

4) Comp- Pay is low all around the board.  Pay is not competitive to Tech Industry market standards in the bay area according to Tableau. I am 10k+ under-market and many of my colleagues are much more. Ambiguous performance metrics, more often than not negatively impact comp. I came for the culture and not for the pay... but I'm quickly learning that might have been a big mistake.

5) TURNOVER- Chances of inheriting an unhealthy book and performing extreme measures to ""revive"" it are high.  GD is bleeding clients faster than we can gain them. Also, some need to be prepared to have difficult conversations with your clients about you being the 3rd 4th or 5th rep that they have been introduced to that same calendar year due to individuals leaving the business or lost to internal promotions without transition plans.

6) Lack of resources invested and shared throughout the whole org from SMB-ENT. Also severely understaffed. 

If any of these are red flags for you as an independent contributor, I would move forward with caution."

Glassdoor is a great company. I can't think of how someone can go through a job seeking process without using Glassdoor. I love the company and it was the reason I chose it over other offers I had at the time. But I wish I could have a better manager. I don't wish to be in another team because all my teammates are knowledgeable and fun to work with. It's just weird how a manger of a hard core back end team doesn't like coding and spent most of his time in meetings without implementing any important piece of code while the company is still a startup. It's ok to be in meetings but it's not right when you are an engineer lead and have more meetings than your project manager. Yes we have a PM. All the team members could see the problem, brought it up but nothing changed. I don't want to go in more details, but I do want to see Glassdoor successful. Look back at the journey I had at Glassdoor, I do realize I learnt many things from my teammates. I'm glad to know and have them in my life. I don't regret my choice, I just wish it could be better for everyone. 

To any new grad: choose your manager for your first job, it should be the highest priority because he/she will be your mentor (or no mentorship at all if you choose a wrong one).","I want to say management, but I can't really say so because I only experienced it in my team.

Our benefits are also great with unlimited PTO, a new 401K match and healthcare 100% paid for the employee.","The CS org has evolved quite a bit over the last couple of years, which has been great however leadership does not listen to their employees and there has been a lot of grey area. 

The first layer is our roles and responsibilities. Leadership continues to give us more responsibility while sales sits around all day and only sends out contracts. They are getting paid significantly more while we are managing accounts, building relationships, identifying and tee-ing up growth opportunities, building all of the decks, and owning almost all communication,  all the while trying to hit our KPI's. If we are holding all of the responsibility, we should be compensated the same way sales is. 

The second layer has to do with our KPI's. With the change to MCV, it is completely unreasonable to get our quotas over a month and a half into the quarter. Not only that, but problems that were identified early on were not fixed until after the end of the quarter. During the first quarter,  our management team told us that KPI's would not change anymore because pacing is obsolete and we can only make the target so low and that product adoption cannot move anymore because it would be unattainable, but here we are a few months later and both of these KPI's have changed. On top of that, we were told we are not moving to marketplace pace yet we are now piloting it. The constant flip flopping and lack of transparency does not give anyone faith in leadership."

You have all the perks of top flight SF start ups that make your day to day easier, but in Marin. Lots of people just do the easy Marin life and you can tell they won't ever leave this place because the quality of life working for a company like this in the north bay, 

You belong to a company who's mission is amazing and brings power to the people. As a sales rep, you often know exactly who and what you need to target in your book, and glassdoor is something no company can ignore. This isn't an organization that counts dials and they try to not micro manage but it's inevitable at times. You have so many outside sources, like candidates bringing up glassdoor reviews in interviews, to keep you relevant and top of mind to prospects. 

Robert is as good as it gets when you think of a top leader to work at the company. His vision we've all joined him on is pretty evident. I get out of bed every day coming in to kick butt and it's easy to do so with him at the top. 

 The vibe is the office is generally awesome as everyone is super eager to help you out, professionally or personally. Some of the most fun you can possibly have at an office is here, but it's not overly fratty or anything like that, that some sales cultures turn into. 

People here are insanely talented and smart, the turnover is low, as glassdoor usually nails who to hire, and people who end up here perform to their manager's expectations.","As far as all the frustrations around comp,Sales op complications, territories and quota, everyone else on here has already said it.  I don't want to echo the thoughts so I'll add some that have been understated.

 We  MUST do something about our comp. It's killing the morale every day here. Yes, BCR's and Quota goes down as revenue goes up at start ups, but the fact that the plans are very sub par compared to the Bay Area, and at best you'll have to do a lot more work for the same OTE. 

 The front line sales team has exceeded expectations every year and told how hard our goals are but how important it is to hit them. So we produce and get not a raise in OTE, but essentially a cut, and at best the same pay with a of a lot more work. Yes, we need to be smart how we run our business (see the horror story that is another SF HR firm) but we can within reason help the team.

Company has been cutting costs left and right, from the desert table at lunch to headcount.  We get that the company is trying to tighten up the bottom line as much as they can but us sales folks who have hit HUGE targets every year were led to believe by middle management we'd adjust for cost of living in 2016.

 I know Glassdoor admit's we can go elsewhere to make more money, and we have stock, but we love this company and this mission. We do not want to leave because we can't afford the life we'd like. And, the stock sales people are given is miniscule compared to others.

As far as selling glassdoor, most people aren't sure what we sell! Seems like it should be an easy sale and a must have for company's right? Unfortunately no, the products are limited and we basically use our amazing and game changing concept to fuel sales.

Second thing anyone considering a sales career here, is your joining a firm who's vastly in the customers favor, and will always lean towards the users ( who don't directly generate revenue) rather than the B2B org.  The solution to sell to firms is really straight forward and simple, but we've struggled (as the whole jobs industry in general) to innovate. We should have lapped our competitors by now, our concept is lightyears ahead of anything anyone else can do but still customers have to opt to legacy platforms because we can't meet their needs. 

This is fine as many other company's are user focused, but the value of the product you sell 100% relies on the traffic numbers our site pulls."
empReview_13766124,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW13766124.htm,Couldn't Ask For A Better Fit,4.0," Senior Account Managerin Mill Valley, CA","Feb 13, 2017","You’ll see this in every review that you read, but the people are what make Glassdoor such a special place. From the moment I set foot through these doors, I was welcomed with open arms. From my manager, whom I would literally follow into a burning building, to my teammates, who are more like my siblings than coworkers. Not to mention all of our amazing teams outside of sales who are often the unsung heroes. Everyone wants to lend a helping hand to get you where you need to be personally and professionally. 

As I mentioned before, my direct manager is a big part of the reason why I am so happy here. Without him I know I would not be where I am today. And that’s true for our whole leadership team. They genuinely want me to be successful here and will do whatever they can to make that happen. 

The last thing I’ll say is that working on the other side of the bridge is pretty great too. When things get a little overwhelming, being able to go outside and walk it out on the bike path overlooking the Bay and Mt. Tam, really help to reset and get back on track. 

Honestly, it’s hard to put into words, but most times it’s just awesome to be a part of this company.","I won’t lie: it’s hard, and some days are harder than others. There’s no getting around putting in the work here. That said, my biggest challenge is the amount of factors that are outside of our control and how that can impact one’s success: where a company is located, how many open jobs they might have compared to the year prior, content issues, a client’s performance, Customer Success, internal processes, etc. These are all challenges we face when trying to hit our quota and it can be very defeating and frustrating. It can sometimes feel like some people are better set up for success than others based on their book of business or their support team.

You’ll likely read some reviews that talk about how our company’s culture is gone. I wouldn’t say that it’s gone, it’s just different. I don’t think we ever lost that Glassdoor family feel, but when you go from personally seeing success over and over to suddenly not, sometimes sending out a few more emails, or leaving one more voicemail becomes more important than a dress up day or monthly award ceremony. Participation is lacking but only because there is a lot of “catch up” to hit numbers. It isn’t just one person who makes a company’s culture, but rather the collective whole, and this past year was rough on the collective whole. 

You’ll also read some reviews about compensation. Living in the most expensive city is not easy. And yes, I would like to get paid more so that maybe one day I can buy a house and maybe even start a family. For now, the office environment and the people are what make the discrepancy in comp bearable, but I do worry that at some point the allure of all that will not shine as bright as it does now."

This used to be a great place to work a year ago and I believe that it has the potential to be that again.","1. Morale- What you are reading in previous reviews about poor morale on the sales floor is echoed by the SDR team. No one wants to be in the office due to the depressing atmosphere and it is shown by empty desks.

2. Management-  Managers are hardly ever in the office and offer very little support. They take long vacations and spend very little time with their teams. When they do spend time with their teams there is very little coaching.

3. Compensation- Comp is low compared to other SDR roles in the Bay Area. When this was pointed out in a previous review management defended the low pay as being close to the national average. Unfortunately rent and living expenses in San Francisco are nowhere near the national average and the sad truth is that most of the SDRs can barely afford to live on the pay even when they are hitting full quota. When I took this job it seemed like an okay income for a year but raises and promotions are hard to come in this role, you can make more doing the same thing elsewhere. 

4. Quota- Quota is high and it keeps going up. The team members who are hitting these quotas are working outside of work hours making it seem like this is obtainable and forcing others to do the same. Often there are factors outside of the SDR's control that affect ability to hit quota and SQLs are loosely defined and up to the individual rep discretion. Once you have a bad month it is very hard to make up for it and get back on track for promotion. 

5. Processes- It seems like every month new processes and regulations are rolled out and that upper management is trying to make their mark on the program by making unnecessary changes. The majority of these processes have been poorly executed, time consuming, and unnecessary. It just keeps getting harder to earn our measly income to (barely) pay the rent. 

6. Career Advancement- Unrealistic expectations were set for career advancement. My advice to people interested in joining the team- ONLY take this position if you are interested in joining the new business AE sales team. Any other position (including CSM, AM, marketing, PR, HR, etc) is basically unobtainable unless you are really lucky and stick around much longer."

I would highly recommend it to anyone considering joining. I would love to see some serious improvement on some tough issues, but what company is perfect? All things considered this place can be a great career accelerator. Come help us get to the next level! 

Pros:

- The people. 93% of the people you'll meet here are genuine, down to earth, kind, good natured, selfless, intelligent, and always willing to help. I've made some friends for life here. 

-Team culture. Largely a function of the wonderful people you'll work with, this is different than overall company culture, this is more about the culture that develops between the individuals you grind with, battling side by side with you day in and day out to get to your numbers. I know this is not applicable to every single team across the company, but all the front line managers that I know here in Chicago aim to develop a fun, winning, close knit team. We truly enjoy each others company, on and off the sales floor. 

- The mission. We're a late stage start up with significant funding from top tier investors that know what they're doing, a recognizable brand name in a large profitable market, and a unique product vision that I can sell knowing wholeheartedly it's in the best interest of my client to invest in us. Transparency, employee engagement, employer branding, diversity/inclusion  - this is the next frontier for companies that value healthy corporate cultures (and they should, based on research connecting employee satisfaction to productivity and bottom line revenue), whether employers like it or not. First it was free snacks, standing desks, and gym memberships - now it's listening to your employees and (at least creating the appearance of) genuinely caring what they have to say. 

- The opportunity. We are a high growth company and if you work hard, succeed in you role, and build authentic relationships with people - there will be opportunity for advancement. That doesn't mean it isn't difficult, you just have to be smart and intentional about how you craft your personal brand and position yourself when the time comes. I will say, the advancement process could use a healthy dose of transparency and over-communication. 

- Work life balance. This actually exists here. Need to duck out early at 2 one day? No problem. Want to take a week off for vacation (with proper notice)? Actually encouraged.  Need to leave work every day at lunch to walk your dog for an hour? Cool. As long as you are communicating your needs in advance and it's not impacting your results, you will have a flexible, understanding manager. 

- Senior sales leadership team. The senior sales leaders at Glassdoor are experienced, communicative, empathetic, and incredibly smart. I believe they have the genuine best interests of the sales team at heart, and I do believe in their vision. 

-Company values. This is subjective, but I'm proud to be part of an organization that strives to make a positive impact in the world.  Filing an amicus brief against the refugee ban. All the research & work we do around the gender pay gap. Making real strides for pay transparency helping working folks negotiate for higher pay. This stuff matters.","-Sales Operations in relation to comp/quota/books. We recently had some turnover in Sales Ops, and for the last 4-5 months the side of sales ops that deals with comp/quota/books has been pretty much a complete disaster area for the growth side of the business, if we're being brutally honest. Couldn't be any worse timing with the transition from FY17 to FY18 and new books/plans being created and rolled out. It's devastatingly demoralizing and unspeakably frustrating when the growth sales leadership team top to bottom either has no clue how sales ops is building books, quotas, and comp plans, or has no say in how they do it. How do you build a comp plan without knowing what quotas and books look like? You end up building a comp plan and sales flow that emphasizes retention, when the quotas actually require much more growth. What in the world is going on? When neither your manager, your director, or your SVP can't/won't give you a straight answer for months and months (the quarter was more than halfway over before we got our quota; we still to this day don't completely understand why we're getting paid out less on our deals than last year), its frankly unacceptable. When we ask about it, we get the response: don't worry it will all make sense eventually and in the meantime the bottom line is you have to sell more into your book than last year (even though there's a new sales motion and some people are struggling with basic living expenses while still hitting growth quotas). Accountability works both ways... If we couldn't give you a forecast for the quarter until more than halfway through, we wouldn't be employed here. If we couldn't explain why we didn't hit our target or why we lost a particular deal, we wouldn't be employed here. And yet we're supposed to be okay with a high degree of ambiguity ""because we're an agile start up."" That excuse for incompetence only goes so far before your top performers are inevitably interviewing elsewhere. I can tell you this - they don't want to. They want to believe in you, sales leaders. We're all looking to you to help us out of this mess, but you don't have much more time. 

-Sales ops issues aside, overall compensation is a slight con. Lower base and OTE compared to similar companies and similar roles. But in reality, b/c of the strength of our brand, you're actually more likely to actually hit your OTE than most smaller companies. 6 months ago, I would have told you it's a lock that you'll make up the lower base in more commission/bonuses. But the changes to the comp plan have made me seriously skeptical of the risk. It also remains to be seen whether the equity plan for recent employees will make up the difference. 

- SMB customer success. Cases take a full day to escalate from customer support to a customer enablement manager. Client emails us with urgent technical issue that requires resolution immediately, but the process takes 48 hours to resolve. AM's have very little visibility into who their assigned CEM is, what CEMs will or won't do, and who they should talk to when there's a problem with an account because CEMs + account assignments change on a quarterly basis it feels like. We get one presentation a year on this, but then in practice it all falls apart. I don't think the problem is the people, they're all great and strive to help to the best of their ability. It's the process and structure that truly boggles the mind. 

-Product performance. Without getting too detailed, some aspects of our products underperform compared to the market and often we struggle to justify ROI with customers. Help us by building a stronger product and improving the type of data we have access to that builds a successful partnership business case."

He is an engineer by training who is respected around the company, and that has made all the difference in terms of quality and thoughtfulness of our core products, and our great company culture. 

There is real work-life balance at Glassdoor, if you make a priority for yourself. I work from home 1-2 days a week to make the commute from the East Bay manageable, and management has supported that. I get my work done efficiently, and in 3 years have never worked a weekend -- aside from travel and 1-2 very unusual weekend fire drills. This is a company you can work at for years and have a great life doing so. 

As we've matured as a company, we're paying more attention to training and development, which is awesome. There are possibilities to move around within the company, and there are regular classes to pick up skills and grow as a professional. 

Glassdoor has a great brand, and that makes it fun to work here.

Glassdoor really has a soul as an organization, and I have learned a lot about culture and management from my time here. 

People are friendly at Glassdoor. Marin is a beautiful place to work. And the free lunch and video games really are great.","Most teams at Glassdoor are small. You might say they are starved for resources. My team hasn't grown at all in years, and it can be frustrating being asked to do more of the same year after year with no additional resources. If you're not in a part of the company that is growing today, it's tough to see a long-term career arc upward. 

In terms of benefits, there is no 401(k) match, would I would like to see happen someday. Otherwise, the benefits are great and management are constantly looking for ways to improve them, by surveying employees. That's great. 

Our headquarters are in Marin because of a historical accident, really.  Now we are split between Mill Valley and SF, because many sought-after job candidates simply aren't willing to work in Marin and have bargained for an SF office. That split isn't great for the company long-term -- we should clearly relocate either into SF so that people can commute in on transit, or into East Bay so people can actually afford to someday buy houses. There are no other top tech companies in Marin (putting AutoDesk aside) for a reason -- it's probably not a sustainable location for Glassdoor long term. 

We are in a very competitive industry and I'm hesitant long-term about our ability to grow and thrive as a company. We are facing intense competition, with larger rivals copying the best aspects of our product and ramping up their investments in marketing. It's a scary competitive landscape facing us right now."

There is also a long way to become truly agile especially now that the organization has grown to a decent size. 

The expectation of people should work extra hours similar to being in a start-up does not really gel well with everything else that is not so start-up like.

Incredible spot in Mill Valley. Open PTO. Many teams doing things that are either bleeding edge or incredibly innovative, making it feel like everything you do, shows in how the business is growing.

CEO is energetic, down to earth, personable, and approachable. Had constant company wide conversations about the direction of the company, and then individual conversations with each department about how the direction impacts them.

Salary for the Bay Area was a little lower than average, but we were not located in San Francisco so most areas were more affordable. Medical/Dental/Vision benefits are 100% if you are single, but are about average if you have a family.","No 401k match. Next to no food near the office, in the event the catered food was awful or was a day there was no lunch. 

Certain teams have management stubborn to the extent of failure. I was brought in as an engineer assigned to re-architect a underpowered and aged environment, to make it scalable, sustainable, and efficient.

Every step of the way, road blocks from my direct manager included undermining my technical experience in lieu of their seniority, constantly assigning tasks that exceeded a 60 hour a week workload, was completely unorganized in assigning priority to tasks that were newly assigned every week.

For example, a task I was assigned to work on 2 weeks ago that was said to have the highest priority, was suddenly de-prioritized and had another task assigned in its place. However there was an expectation that I would still need to complete the previous tasks with the same sense of urgency, if not more. 

This made it nearly impossible to complete any project, and was told that I had an inability to complete tasks or assignments, which (in their opinion) was a display of poor performance on my behalf. This made it feel as though I should not believe in a work/life balance, and should not only spend time at work doing tasks/projects, but spend a significant amount of time at home doing the same. There was an ""always online"" mentality that stemmed through the team, and it made some of the team members feel completely exhausted in their position.

When trying to own a project or have a stake in decision making as far as architecture and technology used for items that I was directly responsible for, this was routinely made for me. My input was often dismissed, with the reasoning being I had not done my research or that I needed a thorough report written in order to even acknowledge my input as an item of discussion.

The executive management my team directly reported to often had completely opposing ideologies and opinions (versus my direct manager) on priority regarding my tasks, responsibilities, and the type of technology and architecture we should be/could be implementing to better the company. At my resignation, much of the ""issues"" that were reflect upon my performance, were in complete opposition to what I was directly told by the executive management of my team. It left me feeling a little lost, and as though the treatment in my current situation was personal.

I did not, however, see this sort of management or attitude on other teams. I do believe Glassdoor is an incredible organization to work for, that can provide ample opportunity to many different people. I do not, however, believe that my specific department is one of the successful areas of the business due to the aggressive management style that seemingly suppresses creative thought or individual input in their roles, duties, or ability to make decisions for the team."

His leadership is what makes GD tick. He practices what he preaches and is as transparent as can be with where the company is heading and what he believes are our biggest challenges are. I have never worked for an organization with a leader as visible and truly committed to the cause as Robert.

Colleagues - There are a lot of great people at GD. Since my first day here, people have been extremely friendly and welcoming.

Benefits - What you would expect from top tech company in Bay Area.","Really feels like we are in that awkward in-between stage as a growing company. I definitely don't feel as confident about the business as I did at the beginning of 2015.

We have also seen a lot of really great, smart sales people leave the org over the last 6 months and that can be disconcerting for the team.

Another challenge is we are first and foremost a consumer site with a mission dedicated to serve job seekers. This doesn't translate as well to our offerings to employers. We regularly work with clients who feel like we are blackmailing them or that GD is a ""necessary evil"" because of the employee reviews. These can be really hard objections to overcome because we have no control over content.

I also think our B2B products are not great. We have not seen anything innovative come through development this year and it feels like the products we do sell are not any different than what our competitors are doing. Results for clients vary greatly and we need to stop selling ourselves as a complete recruiting tool - we do branding really well (soft ROI), but are very inconsistent in helping get direct hires."

Why?
- Nobody hits quota. Our targets are unattainable. Our books of business are saturated, and we're loosing more accounts by the day due to all the hiring happening in Chicago. 

- Nobody gets paid. Glassdoor is well below industry average (by ten's of thousands) when looking at OTE. Per my last note, nobody hits quota, so our pay is even lower compared to all the companies across the bridge in SF.

- Lack of coaching. The training is great when you start, and even in the first year it was good because manager had time for us. Now days, I find that all my coaching comes from my co-workers. And they're smart, which is great, but my managers who are suppose to be the sales experts have no time to invest in me bc we're so low on their priority list. Their focuses: hiring, forecasting, controlling teams that are way too big for their own good. 

- Company culture near gone. This is the most saddening one bc this was the one part that use to separate Glassdoor from all and above. Mill Valley is a ghost town. Everyone is so worked up about getting on a performance plan and wanting to get paid, that there's no time to smell the roses and enjoy each other like we once did. Additionally, our executive team is so focused on profitiability (which is great, and better then someone who isn't tracking that so closely) that it's taken a noticeable priority over investing in their own employees.

I had a smart, strategic and motivating manager with a very tight knit team. I was motivated to come to work every day but also had the freedom to work from home, come in early, leave early and significant flexibility with my schedule. My manager trusted me to get the job done and with that, gave me significantly more confidence and motivation to perform for myself, my manager, my team and the sales org. I wasn't focused on quota, because with the support and confidence my team had in me, along with reasonable targets, hitting quota was challenging but realistic. When I would hit my quota or my team would hit our quota, we would always celebrate those wins. It was an awesome environment and I will forever cherish those days I had at Glassdoor. If I was writing this review one year ago, it would have been a 5 star review.","Essentially everything I mentioned in the Pros no longer exists on the sales floor at Glassdoor. My manager and director were promoted and I was assigned to a new team, manager and director. Very quickly, it was made clear by our director that the flexibility in our work schedule would no longer exist. We were not trusted to get the job done in a way that made sense for each individual, we immediately were given strict activity numbers to hit and an outline for what constitutes being put on a performance plan. This fostered an extremely stressful and cut throat environment that still exists today. While we have added essentially no new products since I've been with Glassdoor and hardly any increase in user traffic... Our quotas have doubled each year. Both years, leadership has come back to us and said that they ""messed up"" in calculating those quotas halfway through the year before making any kind of change to those numbers. While I believe my new manager was a great manager with good intentions, there are way too many reps assigned to one manager. With having to constantly report forecasts and because numbers were the main focus for executive leadership, all managers can really focus on is reporting leaving little time to build a team and individual bond with their employees. 

Needless to say, morale is extremely low. Quotas are way too high and salaries are way too low. People on your sales teams can only take so much. This has been going on for 7+ months. Leadership knows about it and has continued to drive extremely high quotas and activity metrics, constantly bringing in more sales bodies, cutting the books of business and limiting spend on small things like happy hours and team outings that build team comradarie and morale. The list goes on."

I came into this job with a wide variety of experiences from college, and a bit of sales knowledge, but am leaving with a much better understanding of the talent space and sales.

Favorite part: The team and individuals themselves.  Every single person that is on the SDR team fits in with the culture, both in work ethic and personality.  I have a relationship with each one of my teammates that allows for new insights, perspectives, and multiple ways to think about our prospects/tactics to make our numbers.  I always feel supported, and that I can ask any of my teammates for help.  Work life balance has become a lot better, and the unlimited PTO is a main reason why I would love to stay with this company for a while.  

The work itself: It definitely can be a grind.  I think its pretty hard for any sales development role not to be.  But managers are getting better at creating games, and rewarding high call/email volume.

Development: A bit of a struggle towards the end.  We do trainings every Tuesday, and when I started a year ago, I thought they were pretty spot on.  I think the growth of the team has prevented this area of personal development as a lot of these trainings have been a bit basic and repetitive. Since a lot of individuals in the SDR role are newly out of college, I think it would have been helpful to use these trainings to discuss different roles in and out of the sales department, professional development skills (articles/sales blogs), or even hear from other managers and leaders within the company.  Learning about Sandler practices, sales tactics and news about whats happening in other industries that could help us prospect smarter.","What to take away:  With a lot of new hires came a definite change in team camaraderie and culture.  Doubling in team size meant new managers, trainings changing, and more individual tasks.  It can be easy to show up, do work and check out, which I know isn’t Glassdoor’s culture, but making sure to do team bonding activities as an SDR group regularly may be helpful to keep morale high in a repetitive role.  Promotion timelines were not originally set when I joined and individuals have been promoted between 9 and 14 months, which is a pretty wide gap.  Good news is that procedures like quota, qualification, and promotion guidelines (if anything happens when you are hitting above your number consistently) are becoming more solidified/clearer expectations."

There was a strong culture that was clearly defined. Employees were treated extremely fairly, as you'd expect from a company that prides itself on transparency. 

I really liked the head of my department and my immediate manager. They each took the time to understand me as a person and shape the relationship to get the most out of me. Both of them were extremely good at what they did and enabled me to shape my path the way I wanted to. I got to work on a lot of great work and I will always think fondly of the actually core of what I did at GD. Because of my experience at GD, I've gained valuable tools that I will use for the rest of my career.","The whole time I worked at Glassdoor, it felt like I was in Pleasantville and things never felt exactly 'right'. The culture is strong and clearly defined, which is great if it aligns with you. The team is very so homogeneous, that I felt like I was on the outside looking in the whole time. The culture dominated by Tech/Sales Bros, Girls who like dogs/yoga, and lack of ethnic/cultural diversity really turned me off the whole time. The diversity is so poor that I couldn't help but feel like I stuck out like a sore thumb, which made it hard to last longer than I did at GD.

Theres a lot of disconnect between the motivations of the teams and I felt that it added friction to every interaction I had. Whether it be product, sales, engineering, marketing, PR, everyone had their disparate goals and it created mini conflicts all the time. I think in order for GD to thrive, the goals need to converge and teams need to compliment each other rather than fight for resources."

empReview_15848541,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW15848541.htm,Still Crazy (fun) After All These Years,4.0," Director of Jobs and Search Operationsin San Francisco, CA","Jul 11, 2017","I have forged some incredible friendships, relationships and memories over the course of my time at Glassdoor, and I don't want it to end yet.  Having been here longer than most, it has been a real treat watching this company evolve, scale and step up to each of the new challenges that we face.  It's never a dull moment, and has always been a fast paced journey, and I am proud to be a part of it.  

People you work with here are generally motivated and hungry to make an impact and show value.  Glassdoor has helped me grow and mature, particularly in engaging and communicating with peers and colleagues effectively, and while many companies may talk about trying to foster an open-sharing collaborative environment, Glassdoor actually puts it into practice.  As in life, nothing is perfect and it doesn't always mean that every single interaction you are going to have here is going to be the most amazing one ever, but we strive to bring a general standard in these types of engagements.  I think it subtly permeates through the org and relieves stress proactively for us, even when feeling like things are going as smoothly as they should.

The culture has evolved and changed, and rightfully so.  You can't expect the company to be the same company it was 5 years ago, when we were a fifth of the size.  Through it all, there is still a solid rock and foundation which innately bleeds green, and it can never die.","Adjusting to scale has been a hard challenge.  Like with most scenarios involving masses of people, it's hard to please and satisfy everyone.  Because we have an open collaborative environment, it's not uncommon to hear those dislikes, groans or sighs of disapproval from some folks.  The challenge has been keeping the course, and pushing harder through those moments of adversary and doing small corrections, rather than tacking so frequently and disrupting our line.

We suffer a little bit from a resourcing and sizing problem, particularly in our core engineering areas.  We want to deliver so much, but are not willing to really push and pony up for the resources for where they matter most.  Moving fast comes at a price, and we haven't figured out which one to pay into, speed or efficacy."

- Fast internal growth opportunities
- Level and responsibility isn't age dependent
- Culture that embraces fail, but fail fast, pivot and learn (critical for a tech company)
- Perks (free breakfast, lunch, and sometimes dinner, Budget for team building events like Giants Games or Glassdoor Olympics, nice onsite gym and free fitness classes before, during, and after work, 4 beers and kambucha on tap, and kayaks/bikes available to check out, communiter benefits, fantastic 100% contribution to healthcare, decent bonus structure)
- Though Leader in employer branding and reducing the gender pay gap
- Lots of focus on employee health, physically and mentally
- Great to feel absense of ownership in the organization and a critical driver to its success","Glassdoor does have some downsides:
- It might have a few years under its belt, but it operates very much like a start-up. The downside to that is that it lacks a lot of processes that other organizations of the same size have in place. It is a positive thing, though, if you want to have input in building processes for your team. 
- Some legacy decisions solved for more short term solutions than for long term ones, resulting in some additional re-work now so we can better scale for the future
- Internal politics are at every company, and Glassdoor is no different. No worse than your average company, but I had hoped a company this young would have less of that
- Run lead with large ambitions. I have never worked longer than my standard hours in my 10+ years of experience. I feel so many of us have such high objectives with less than necessary resources that so many of us are working 10+ hour workdays. 
- Hesitation to change previous decisions even if necessary to keep up with the times."

Every recruiter will see Glassdoor on your resume and know what you worked on, making 'GD' a good stepping stone.

The PR team is world class.

Glassdoor also allows for a good work life balance (given you are exempt status...), and people for sure take advantage of it.","The culture is shot, the company is no where near being profitable, and the cash burn rate isn't getting better.

Theres no fun and inspiring management, no company cohesiveness, and there is absolutely no shared goals. This company has been torn to shreds by sales culture and has a 'work hard burn out and sell sell sell' feel. Everyone is in panic mode trying to prove how valuable and important their work is to the flawed business model.

This rushed culture makes everyone produce work that they're not proud of, and it shows. Things are shipped broken, just so management can say ""hey we did this, just like I said! Now give me more stock and a raise.""

If you're a manager that wants to build a team and do awesome things, prepare to get over ruled by ""this is the way its alway been done."" If you're an engineer looking to make something you're proud of, prepare to spend half a day coding and a week explaining why you coded it that way.

Lastly - compensation. Don't expect to get any substantial units from Glassdoor. They're just not there for you to take. Plus, the ones you have wont make you any money (there was even a quarter where strike price went down). Plus half of the company got taken off exempt status, thus striping them of freedoms that are core to Glassdoor's culture."

There is an opportunity to learn and grow not only as an employee, but as an individual. Everyone is very passionate about what they do and there is no shortage of drive (until recently).","There is a reason behind my 3 star review. With an ever evolving business, I understand that changes need to be made. One of the perks of working at GD is an ""uncapped commission,"" meaning if a rep performs well, the opportunity to make more money is there. Recently, we had a shift in our compensation plan that changed this. We were told that the reason quotas being rolled out in April were delayed was due to perfecting the compensation plans, yet we were to find out that the drastic changes were not communicated to our leadership and then to us. Now, we have capped commission and we've removed all bonuses for retaining current client base. All ""bonuses"" that we can receive for hitting our numbers each quarter are already built into our target, rather than extra money we can make after hitting full quota. This is causing those with extreme drive and passion to feel that's not enough - quotas are too high and impossible to hit."

My teammates were really great people and did a lot to help me get up and running. 
-Solid product and mission
-Good benefits
- Fun office atmosphere and perks
-Competitive pay","I  have a lot of them because my experience was pretty awful in the end.  For starters, after receiving the offer, they were tiptoeing around the idea of pulling the offer back but eventually they did not ( I can't remember the exact wording but it was very confusing). They changed my start date 3 times. It took them a month and half to decide whether or not I had a guarantee or not for the first few months I was not on book. Once they did decide to give me one (it was generous) they changed the amount on me 2 times. Training was pretty good but I wish they would have had more of a focus on the growth side of the house. It was set up for new biz.

Leadership had told me they wanted to hit the road with me and I planned a long trip in my territory only to have them bail on me last minute. I performed well on my own but it was just  sign of how upper management effects the day to day big time with their last minute asks. I feel like no matter what I did it was never enough, I brought back a solid verbal from a client that we were going to grow an additional 80% and I got flack for it. I felt really good about all the work I put in and the result was really big for my book and team but the feedback I got was that I needed to push the client even harder.  

This all came to a head when I was let go without any prior warning or notice, despite being lauded company wide just a few weeks before for hitting my monthly quota. Just days before I was also told I had been performing well and had been great a receiving the coaching management had provided to me. I also had forecasted to crush my goal for the current month, so there were no signs of poor performance. Additionally, in the weeks prior to this management had laid out a program that had specific criteria we needed to hit to be in ""good standing"" and it was mentioned that there would be conversations along the way if an individual was not meeting those standards. I never had any of those conversations. 

This was a really shady situation as I was randomly pull into a room and told I no longer had a job at Glassdoor (given no explanation whatsoever about why I was let go). Leadership said one sentence and then left the room, it was gutless.  I do not know who was truly behind this or why I was let go. I went back to collect my things and the entire side of the office was cleared out so I could not interact with anyone. Just a terrible situation while working at a company that preached transparency and living by G.R.I.T.  This was just like a company with a bad GD rating, there were no values I was just a number to them. 

I had two former colleagues in the interview process with GD and had to tell them that I was let go out of nowhere without any information given to me. It did not make GD look very good at all. 

A lot of things were said about this company and my team being a family but frankly this was not my experience based on the results of my employment. Dealing with HR was not pleasant at all either. They shut off my Cobra when they were not supposed to and were just difficult to deal with in general. Oh and I think in general because its a young company, there is a lot of drinking together and for me personally I feel like it set me back not being in that crowd as I don't drink much. 

And of course after all that they just sell the company a month after my termination so that may have certainly played a factor in things as well. Apparently its all about the all mighty dollar and selling out to a foreign company. 

Overall I would say I just wish things went differently, I felt ok most of the time and enjoyed being there and just battled through these issues thanks to the support of my teammates. I never would have thought this company being who they are and what they represent would have treated me like this. Be careful."

- Lucky to have coaching and mentorship from both Mariah in HR and Jim Mitchell. These two people really get people, feedback and how to build/scale a culture.
- Company is going thru significant growth and beating all goals (we can still do better!). We're disrupting a BIG recruiting market and every day feels like we're moving closer towards owning the market and our competition.
- Lots of love and goodwill from customers and the market in general, people really want Glassdoor to succeed and bring a fresh dynamic to the market.
- Incredibly smart leadership team that makes decisions based on data and metrics vs. emotion. This can be a double edged sword because of the detail and depth of analysis but its the right thing to do for the business.
- Lack of egos and this starts with the CEO. I've seen egos destroy company culture in previous companies but at Glassdoor everyone is down to earth, approachable, humble and pretty passionate about doing the right thing.
- Flexible working hours. I wouldn't say amazing work/life balance but Glassdoor does let employees work and play when they need to. If the work gets done employees have freedom to leave early, take PTO and be flexible in when they work.
- I love the young hustling scrappy culture across the company. Its great to see this across all teams who clearly want to make a difference.","- The relationship between B2C and B2B feels like its drifting apart and becoming ever-more silo'd. Doesn't feel like we have common goals which align and unite the two sides of the business so that we're both successful. You can't have one without the other and both need to appreciate that so that we work together to make everyone successful.
- Making a startup successful is not easy, most don't make it. The only constant in a startup is change and quickly figuring out what works and what doesn't so you can improve. I feel this needs to be better communicated as there is often lots of unnecessary complaints and moaning about change. Our company is founded on transparency and feedback, everyone should learn to give and receive it in a constructive way so that we move forward together and avoid the toxic passive aggressive comments.
- Car Park shouldn't be empty at 4:45pm on a Thursday evening. Not quite sure what is going on. I'm all for work/life balance but this is a startup environment where everything counts. We can't have certain teams working flat out and grafting with others leaving early, it just doesn't feel right. Signing up for a startup is about making an impact, working hard and achieving things that the competition couldn't dream about achieving."

Career growth, especially in the beginning of my time was accessible in every way.  There are more processes in place now, but if you have a strong reputation and work hard, it will get recognized. Leaders have always put my best interests and asks first, building trust and loyalty.

In Chicago, there is plenty of growth, excitement and proactive dedication to culture and unity. As employees move up in the organization, there is more and more flexibility to your schedule and process, especially in sales. This can be good/bad at the same time. 

At the Enterprise level, it was difficult to feel motivated to hold yourself to a higher standard, to continue growing in your sales skills or trial out new processes, which may just be the stage the company is at.

From an organizational perspective, in terms of trajectory, Glassdoor’s future seems fuzzy. I often found myself feeling like we are plateauing. Product hasn’t developed in years (truly), and senior leaders come and go, which can be difficult news to hear in the Bay Area specifically. Tenured employees, including leaders, seem checked out. Yet, I believe leadership recognizes this and are looking to step up their game, but need insight and outside resources to understand as to how to make a large culture shift like this."

It is awesome to have the free food provided as well as catered lunches from time to time.  Having workout classes we can attend and still get paid is pretty awesome.  It is also nice to have the ability to work from home if something comes up rather than have to take PTO.  The holidays are fun around here as they are kind of a big deal.  It is fun to dress up at Halloween and do some other fun things around Christmas.  It really breaks up the days when we do things like this.  Having dogs come into the office has been fun.

There are times where you have to continue to refresh to try to get into a queue you are trying to work in.  This does happen on a daily basis.  You will frequently receive an error message and you just have to keep refreshing until the site decides it wants to allow you access what you are trying to access.  It wastes a lot of valuable time.  It is still hard for me to believe that even after 10 years, there are still these types of issues with the website for a tech company.  Rather than finding a fix for certain types of things, we have become too accepting of finding a way to work around the problem rather than try to get someone to fix it.  It is great that we have smart people who can find ways to work around the problems that we have, but we really need to stop being so accepting of finding these and push for more permanent, functional fixes."

I worked as an Account Executive; when I fell below quota and voiced my concern, little to nothing was done to troubleshoot my performance.  Instead I was put on a “soft” activity plan (make x number of calls, meetings, etc.), but was not told my job on the line.  A month later, I was told that my last day at the company would be in 6 days. 

This appalled me as countless reps who have fallen below quota attainment have been put on a quarter-long plan to get them back on track.  This was the standard as I had come to know it.  

The company I knew for the past 2 years was gone.  It was a place where management had a pulse on the health of their team, making sure everyone was excited to be working there and more excited for the opportunities ahead.  Now it has warped itself into a culture that takes exclusive interest in performance metrics, star performers, and working its teams to the bone with very little concern for their wellbeing.

During my exit interview, HR informed me that performance plans at Glassdoor are not “policy” but a “best practice.”  They (HR) told me that managers at our company have full discretion to terminate an employee if they aren’t a fit for the role and a performance plan wouldn’t have the desired effect.  To say the least, this made me feel discriminated against, as I had seen this same situation (same people, same role, similar quota) treated in a different and abrupt fashion."

From the top down, GD has a culture of hiring really, really cool people with great personalities who are easy to talk to and work with -- pretty much everyone who is at GD is smart, driven, and excellent. The mission is excellent. There are some real winners among the newly hired leadership, and of course, the CEO is a wonderful guy.","Before you sign up to work here, let's remember that this is a Series H company. Series H. There is a reason for that. Look up the tech companies that have successfully gone public, and look at their series beforehand. Headlines scream that GD is a $1BN company about to go public, but valuation says nothing about effectiveness of the business. And a great mission isn't enough. Valuation is also set by investors, and right now, the investors want their money back. Compared to what GD may have once been, these realities create a different culture with a lot of pressure. While leadership does a good job of shielding everyone else from this, the pressure manifests in covert ways that are counter to GD's principles of transparency. Given changes in the recruiting marketplace, GD's products are not getting easier to sell, and an entrenched codebase make it difficult to iterate productively to modernize the product features. All of the above affects the day-to-day."

People want to work here because they believe in what we do and how we're helping others. This is why most of us take the job here, high or low salary.","Someone else said this perfectly: I feel like Glassdoor broke up with me. 

There are a LOT of us who were hired with a promise of certain benefits, work style, and career development. But they have recently just decided to change all this and force employees to go from exempt to non-exempt - even people who have been here for years - based on their job title/status and strip them away of their benefits. Our so called ""unlimited"" PTO is now restricted to 15 days and to make that worse, we're now only starting with 7 days. What if we didn't take much vacation over the years?

But it goes beyond PTO. The majority of us that took the offers took it with everything it has to offer, including the ability to give it our all. That means loving the hours we work outside of the office, no matter how long it is, because we love what we do and we want to contribute all that we got. But now, with a strict 40 hour week (and some departments aren't even granting OT because of budget reasons), how are we supposed to do this? Some of us have huge projects, deals, clients that we want to take full responsibility for...but now we can't. We have to pass it on to other ""exempt"" employees. 

Like someone else said, this feels like we've just got grounded and belittled. How are we supposed to feel that we're valued? People are ACTUALLY saying that they're exempt because their job is more valued, or fancier. This is wrong and this is not the culture we, or I, signed up for. 

We all love what we do, no matter what level we are. I want to love coming into work, knowing that I'm bringing the same amount of value as everyone else. If I don't feel that way, that's wrong."

Glassdoor’s CS org is an absolute mess and has been for over a year.

 A certain Leader has dismantled the entire org and left countless employees in their wake. They rule with an “off with your head” mentality. A beloved and well liked leader before them was fired with seemingly no explanation until shortly after they assumed his role. Whatever lightheartedness and trust that was left in CS evaporated over the last six months I was there. After voicing concerns about my manager who was eventually terminated (which was a 16+ month ordeal the CS team had to deal with I won’t get into)  I had the misfortune of being on said leaders radar. 

Our team never had KPIs, and it was always said to be something that was coming. In a team meeting said leader announced they would need “at least a year” to have solid performance metrics, once again postponing them. This was a turning point for me as  they were extremely defensive and combative when we said it had already been almost two years without them.  They just could not understand. No empathy. Fine, another year. 

Despite documented positive performance reviews up until this point, my final review was brutal which also meant I missed out on my bonus I worked hard for.  Then I found myself being invited to a vaguely titled  “meeting” with the leader at the end of the week at 2 pm.  I was understandably very nervous.

During the “meeting” they spent 40 minutes asking me repeatedly “what do you want to do?” badgering me in ways that felt like an interrogation instead of whatever they thought this “meeting” was. They told me things like “people” called me “toxic”. Yes, those words. When someone in a position of power speaks to you that way it has the ability to make you question a whole lot about yourself. It was the low point of my entire career. I felt sick that I’d somehow ended up at a company where they condoned this kind of behavior. 

Luckily I am experienced enough to know exactly what they were doing to try and get me to resign after I’d spoken up one too many times. I fear others may not have been able to take the insults. When I pushed back and asked the intention of the meeting and if they could understand how it would be jarring for a junior staff member to have a meeting with a leader added to their calendar with zero context - once again they were incredibly defensive and claimed I should have known it was coming. (I didn’t, I had some of the highest numbers on the team and great relationships at the office). 

I made up my mind to leave that day and leave I did, but it’s important I call out why. This is still happening. I know others have been called out as well. The lack of professionalism and blatant disregard for feedback has made for a horrible work environment that continues to deteriorate. People work in fear of having to answer to leadership or opening an email with another decision resulting in a major change with zero benefit to the employee. The irony of the company being “Glassdoor” is palpable. I know other departments are better, but I urge you to not join CS. They do not care about tenure, intent, merit, or grit - they only care about egos and bottom lines. I watched countless people leave and my biggest regret is waiting so long before I did myself. I kept thinking things would change and they did, just never anything but for the worse. Truly a nightmare."

We have outstanding tools to help with onboarding, training, development & supporting mental health.

Flexible working is definitely here and the managers support whatever fits your lifestyle - without judgement. There is a strong level of trust amongst the teams and we are all working toward the same goals and overall Glassdoor strategy.

The product is constantly evolving and improving! Now with the acquisition of Fishbowl, there are even more exciting things coming.

Great benefits like company wide holidays, unlimited vacation days, private insurance","- Partnership with Indeed is still a struggle, but management on both sides are working to improve this. Reps also need to take ownership here to successfully manage and improve their Indeed relationships.

- Even after a recent review, and based on Glassdoor's own site data, certain roles are still underpaid. Glassdoor talks about retaining top talent, but does not pay them competitively.

- Changing commission plans. Sales reps do not have an annual target. It was quarterly only, but now we currently have 6 month targets. This is unlike any other sales organisation I have been a part of, and creates the perception that Glassdoor has the ability to change the commission plan to work in their favour if you are over achieving. 

Since the partnership 2 years ago, Glassdoor is still too reliant on Indeed account team alignments and strategies. I understand why, but sadly, it is the client is who misses out the most with all the changes and internal shifts. 

Some senior leaders are a bit out of touch of what the GTM teams go through and the day-to-day issues faced each day by the 'boots on the ground'."

From leaders to individual contributors, everyone at this organization contributes to a culture of positivity, moral fiber, and transparency. I've never seen an organization more committed to maintaining its values and constantly challenging the status quo in pursuit of improvement. Leadership is very receptive to feedback and criticism and is constantly attempting to better the workplace for employees and improve the value delivered to customers. Not only does Glassdoor's leadership pursue radical goals around transparency within the products they build, but also the Company holds itself accountable to those goals within the inner workings of the organization and its internal communication.","At any organization, there is always room for improvement. At Glassdoor, I find that the biggest challenge is breaking the historical organizational mold to adapt to the new demands of a growing business. I often believe that while the organization is succeeding, the internal departmental structure is a step behind the needs of the business. In many cases Glassdoor's team structure lags behind industry competitors in terms of investing in business intelligence and data analytics resources. It seems that the Company needs to shed some of the start-up level infrastructure mentalities and transform its internal data and insights model into a more mature organization. I feel that teams often have to remain scrappy to aggregate and analyze data in order to make informed decisions when there are tried and true tools and corporate structures that work well to solve these types of problems."

Everyone has their heart in the right place - wanting to do the best for our users, our clients and internally for our people. People genuinely believe in the mission and the positive impact we can have on the world.

The people are also smart and driven but understand the need for time for family and out of work activities. There is a lot of respect for your personal time and I think in general Glassdoor offers a good work life balance.

I've also seen over the past few years the maturing of the company as it brings more structure (mostly for the better) to its operations. For instance, professionalizing planning with OKRs, salary benchmarking to ensure fair pay, well organized and thoughtful All Hands meetings, etc.

I recognize that the company has been through a lot of changes in recent months, not least of which was the impact of Covid. The CEO and Board's decision to let go 30% of the workforce, while very painful at the time, was the correct and responsible thing to do. It ensured the business was set up for future success and that there would be no drip-feeding of redundancies. I can see that Christian (our CEO) is deeply considerate and does not take these kind of decisions lightly. He was dealt a very tough hand of cards in recent months and has responded with courage and compassion. He feels the weight of his responsibilities and this comes through in the extent to which he makes himself vulnerable and transparent.

For a tech/product standpoint, I personally am very excited by the new strategy direction and believe we will have a lot of impactful and innovative products to bring to market.

Overall Glassdoor is a great employer and I would highly recommend it!","Every company has its cons and Glassdoor is not an exception. I think there are a few key areas that Glassdoor could improve:
- Sense of urgency: I think some areas of the org are strongly professionalized and the people act with urgency. Whereas with others it seems that follow up emails are sometimes necessary to solicit a response. This is just an example, but at times there is a 'big company' mentality whereas I believe we could have more of a startup, get stuff done approach (even if it means we mess up sometimes - better to move fast then get bogged down with bureaucracy).
- Meeting overload: sometimes what could be achieved in a well structured email is repackaged as a meeting. I would encourage us to set the bar higher before booking the time of colleagues. This isn't a big issue but you do see meetings occurring that would have been better served through an email."

I love the fact that I can work independently and the support for WFH has been awesome. We have a strong People team that has really come into its own during the pandemic.
I fully support the new strategy shift and the drive for transparency. However, the pace of change is scary and dramatic. We've rolled the dice in a major way and I hope for all our sakes that it works out. You can't deny that there are some pretty bold changes kicking off right now.","Unfortunately, while I have had a good run, I fear that post-restructure I am running out of road. It wasn't Glassdoor's fault that COVID-19 came along and I believe senior management acted in the best interests of the company in letting 30% of the workforce go. Some of those people will be sorely missed, others, not so much. However, this has had a dramatic affect on my day-to-day role and the outlook for my development and progression is not good right now. 
I hope this situation changes, and you can never tell what is around the corner, but right now my scope is severely limited. I wish I wasn't facing this situation, but I just can't see how to haul myself out of it and there is no magic wand for Glassdoor to wave. It is gut-wrenching."

Great Product Line","Lack of transparency when it comes to future planning.
Most of us feel like just a number during this transition period and we're doing a lot of hard work for no reward.
Lots of change recently and more to come but when it comes to communicating the change it's been horrific. A change is announced then that change changes and then changes again. During some recent changes some of us told SLT here are some problems that we'll face and they were ignored and now the problems are at our door and they're now trying to correct them. All we ask is to be heard and to also know the UK is different to the US.
With the new structure the pay and commission is not aligned within teams and it's all but been swept to the side.
In many cases we aren't rewarded on all of the work we do and it just gets passed off to someone else to benefit from with the explanation that that's the rules sorry about no exceptions."

- On boarding and training is far too short and condensed despite the sheer amount of new tools/systems one has to learn.
- Lack of communication between upper management often led to confusion and distrust within the team as guidance was not always clear. 
- Work life balance is extremely poor, many SDR's were working overtime and on holidays to reach targets and push out massive amounts of volume to reach ridiculously high weekly KPI's set out by managers.

Everyone has their heart in the right place - wanting to do the best for our users, our clients and internally for our people. People genuinely believe in the mission and the positive impact we can have on the world. 

The people are also smart and driven but understand the need for time for family and out of work activities. There is a lot of respect for your personal time and I think in general Glassdoor offers a good work life balance.

I've also seen over the past few years the maturing of the company as it brings more structure (mostly for the better) to its operations. For instance, professionalizing planning with OKRs, salary benchmarking to ensure fair pay, well organized and thoughtful All Hands meetings, etc. 

I recognize that the company has been through a lot of changes in recent months, not least of which was the impact of Covid. The CEO and Board's decision to let go 30% of the workforce, while very painful at the time, was the correct and responsible thing to do. It ensured the business was set up for future success and that there would be no drip-feeding of redundancies. I can see that Christian (our CEO) is deeply considerate and does not take these kind of decisions lightly. He was dealt a very tough hand of cards in recent months and has responded with courage and compassion. He feels the weight of his responsibilities and this comes through in the extent to which he makes himself vulnerable and transparent. 

For a tech/product standpoint, I personally am very excited by the new strategy direction and believe we will have a lot of impactful and innovative products to bring to market.

Overall Glassdoor is a great employer and I would highly recommend it!","Every company has its cons and Glassdoor is not an exception. I think there are a few key areas that Glassdoor could improve:
- Sense of urgency: I think some areas of the org are strongly professionalized and the people act with urgency. Whereas with others it seems that follow up emails are sometimes necessary to solicit a response. This is just an example, but at times there is a 'big company' mentality whereas I believe we could have more of a startup, get stuff done approach (even if it means we mess up sometimes - better to move fast then get bogged down with bureaucracy).
- Meeting overload: sometimes what could be achieved in a well structured email is repackaged as a meeting. I would encourage us to set the bar higher before booking the time of colleagues. This isn't a big issue but you do see meetings occurring that would have been better served through an email."

For my role I feel I am paid fairly and when we had a physical office in Dublin, I felt we were well taken care of in terms of the usual perks (office snacks, team nights out etc). Hopefully the company will find a way to continue that while we work from home for the foreseeable due to COVID-19. 

In the past I always felt that career opportunities were great at the company - I am unsure if this will continue, but hope it will. 

At the moment I feel that management and leadership are listening to what we have to say, and our opinions are being taken on board. 

Working from home has been great and the flexibility that the company has always shown in terms of time off is a huge positive. I am hoping we can continue to work from home on a permanent basis but that is still TBC.

Overall I am still happy to be working for Glassdoor but there are huge challenges ahead.","Let's be honest, the slashing of around 55 jobs in Dublin and 300 globally was handled terribly. It felt like a house we had been building for years had just been hit by a bomb. 

The announcement was handled badly. We have preached transparency for years and at the moment when we needed it most, leadership failed. 

The reviews on this page from Dublin pre-March 2020 are now worthless as this is no longer the same company. It is a similar company, but definitely not the same one I have worked in for 4 years .

The reorganisation has been a bit of a mess and I think it will be the same for the next 6-9 months. - I guess that is to be expected with such a large change in strategy. 

Unfortunately with the recent changes, we now have no high level leadership on the ground in EMEA and we have gone back to being led by the US. This did not work in the past, and it wont work going forward. We need someone with overall responsibility for the region to be actually in the region to deal with issues if / when they arise.

With the reorganisation, the jobs we were previously doing have changed significantly, and to be honest a lot of us feel like we have been demoted (despite the company message that we have not)."

Number one is that there are great people working at Glassdoor not just in Dublin but beyond. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful and will do all they can to help you achieve and succeed. 

While you will always be busy and it's not 9-5 (some days you come in earlier and go home later), there is always an element of fun and humour in the office. 

Salary, bonus and benefits are great compared to other similar roles in tech startups. 

The role itself is demanding and good organisation around calendar, email and phone calls is key to being successful. Training for everything is provided but you do need to be a fast learner to take it all in.

If you like working in a target based environment then being an SDR at Glassdoor is the perfect job.

-Friendly and approachable mid and senior management
-Salary not bad for the work involved
-Great work/life balance
-Career progression

The best part about my time with Glassdoor was by far the people. Intelligent, funny and warm you always found someone willing to help.

Great times were had and a lot has been learned from others.

Management were approachable and were always laid back and willing to listen. I have never seen senior management interact with the teams so much and that was refreshing. 

For the work involved the salary was OK. The work wasn't back breaking or ever encroaching on your personal life. You never had anyone breathing down your neck.

Although not completely structured there was great opportunity for progression.","-Very poor communication
-No KPIs (Some would see this as a pro)
-Little to no process or structure
-Way too many fluff meetings
-Onboarding was shocking

Communication is a major issue with Glassdoor. Huge updates were poorly timed, a two paragraph email could turn into a 45 minuet meeting, some comments and feedback came across as very snarky and personal, and at least 75% of the meetings were not necessary. 

In my role at KPIs did not exist or very few that were measured anyway. KPI's are the core structure to measure success, improve processes and make the customer journey seamless. 

Half the 1-1's I had there was nothing to discuss.

There are little to no processes, no documentation, no email templates nothing.

If something did exist it was 5 years old and hadn't been updated. Something as simple as a credit to an account was an arduous task as no one knew the process.

There was never a day without a meeting and as said before 75% of these meetings were not needed. It was all about how great the product is and how great things are going and how the sales teams targets are calculated.... (All teams were invited to these meetings even non sales) 

Cut the chatter on fluff. More training's, meaningful content, learning. 

This should be where that time is utilized you cant expect a slack channel to be the prime place to learn how to do your job.

The on-boarding was shocking, half of the content was sales focused (I was not on the sales org) the enablement team spend the whole year planning for the Sales Kick Off. 

I think in over a year there I had 2 training's with the enablement team. Unfortunately neither were useful to my role. 

Training's are only rolled out as a reactive measure to an update etc."

The team are all so lovely and respectful and the work environment is great. Everyone is very driven about the Glassdoor mission and very passionate about their work. Glassdoor as an employer is super flexible and appreciates the work/life balance of their employees. You also get a lot of opportunity at Glassdoor to use your skills and develop professionally. It's still in many ways a start-up which clearly isn't for everyone but really what difference do you expect to make at the alternative, a 10k+ employees professional network company based in central London? If you want to really contribute and feel like your work makes a difference then you should work for Glassdoor. 

The direct management in my team was very supportive, great mentors and anything but micro-management. Generally Glassdoor doesn't really do micromanagement  which also means you should know to manage yourself. 

Other pros are the competitive salary, great office location, nice team events, progression and autonomy. 

Talking for the London office, I wouldn't say the negative reviews really give an accurate idea of the work environment. There's challenges that come with any start-up but most comments do not resonate with my experience in any way.

I can truly recommend Glassdoor to anyone that is looking for a meaningful job, with tons of learning opportunities, room for growth, amazing colleagues and a healthy work environment.","I had no reason whatsoever to leave on my own initiative for above reasons but the company decided to let me go due to focus shift away from most EMEA markets. Very disappointing and sad but I respect tough decisions need to be made in order to move the business forward - although in all modesty I believe this was a poor decision made by higher management as I (as well as my colleagues in the other markets) build up tons of relationships within industry and media landscape that will be hard to rebuild when focus will be shifting back to those markets. In addition to that we took on so many different tasks outside of our original jobs such as sales, marketing, pr, etc. (which I loved as never a day was the same), while getting paid for 1 which is a pretty good deal for the company I'd say. It's like spending ages on building a sand castle and then kicking it in. What monster does that, no offense. Anyway I'm all for flexible redundancy rules but perhaps in a more constructive way."

Glassdoor is the perfect place for me to really grow. Senior management genuinely cares about why people work here, and what each of us wants to get out of our experience here - and asks how can they do better. I feel as though I have room to grow, I am challenged daily, and I feel like I have a voice - all things that are not common these days. I like my co-workers, and there really is a team feel here. A company which is built on a model of transparency needs to really embrace that model, and I'm happy to say Glassdoor does from the top down. We are in rapid growth mode, and it's so very exciting to be a part of it. Helping job seekers make the right choice was a big motivator for me, having been unhappy in previous roles - and if I can help someone make a good decision, I'm happy. This is one of only two times I haven't been looking for another job in my career ... being happy at work is important - it makes your whole life better (my husband is certainly happier), and I can say I have found what I think is the perfect place for me.","There is some disorganization in process, but that's to be expected from a start up. If you are the kind of person who needs a firm procedure in place for how to do everything, this is likely not the place for you.

One of the great things is that most people, if not everyone, has a stake in the company, therefore we all treat it like 'our' company.

I have joined at a really exciting time as we are expanding internationally and I'm proud to be a part of that. We are still a small enough company to all to get together in one large room, which I love.

I fully believe that Glassdoor is destined for greatness on a global scale and I personally enjoy working here very much. I look forward to every day, I understand and support the mission of the company, I know how I can make a difference and my goals are clear. I feel like I am well supported by my manager and wider team in the US and I also feel like the work-life balance is good. Our benefits program is slowly improving but the main benefit for me are the share options, which I value highly. 
The culture in London is good (in my opinion) although perhaps a work in progress. We get together and socialise pretty regularly. We always have team events in  the pipeline and I enjoy everyone's company in the office. 
Some of us have been around for a while now and, just as with any company, others have left for various reasons. It hasn't worked out for some people, but at the end of the day, that's life. Glassdoor isn't for everyone and some people have probably had a pretty rough time and struggled, but I have thrived here. I feel appreciated by the CEO and in return I feel a strong sense of loyalty. There's no magic formula: if you like your job and you are good at it, you do well.","Let's be honest, we're not there yet, in terms of where I want Glassdoor to be in Europe nor where I thought we would be at this point in 2017. As a company, we're having to re-focus and set ourselves up for success, and I accept that. This is quite normal for a hyper-growth company. I'm not concerned about our strategy or momentum, but it doesn't mean that I'm not fed up about being temporarily restricted in terms of my scope. 

My hours can be quite long and there is certainly a lot of scrutiny and pressure. However, I've always felt that I can take the time I need to recharge as well as have flexible working. 

If you like an all-singing, all-dancing benefits scheme, everything on a plate, easy-sell corporate environment with massive salaries, then Glassdoor is not for you. If you don't mind pushing the envelope and you are resilient enough to rough it a bit on the journey, then Glassdoor could take you into a new league in terms of what you thought you could achieve and where you thought your career could go. You need to see the bigger picture and not get caught up on little things if you want to be satisfied working here.

It’s been an incredible experience working in the EMEA Headquarters and I definitely got what I applied for. 

The product - Glassdoor is changing the way people look for jobs and so many people I know have used Glassdoor to help them in their job search. It's really inspiring to be part of that - even though we work on the employer side. 

 It's an exciting time to be part of Glassdoor EMEA. In the last 2 years, clients have become a lot more open to discussing Glassdoor and putting budget aside for employer branding. The product is going to get easier to sell and clients are seeing more ROI. The office is beginning to grow again (after some heavy attrition last year) which is great to experience if you are looking to grow your sales career and get access to opportunities outside your primary role eg. Training new employees, being involved in interviews ect. 

The office is young, most people are under 35. There's good fun and there's great banter between employees. It's a becoming a collaborative environment which is great to see and there is a close-nit feel, especially in the SDR team. 

Access to Stock Options. As a pre-IPO company you have the chance to purchase stock (after a vesting period) with the potential to make money if Glassdoor IPO's or gets acquired.","Firstly, there’s needs to be more transparent communication. Some of our senior leaders aren’t really open to feedback and it’s left some employees feeling frustrated and unheard. This has led a number of people to leave. We want to practice what we preach with the product that we sell eg. Read the reviews on our page, take feedback on board, make relevant changes but  that’s not happening in EMEA. This leads to people speaking to each other in private and not giving feedback to management (because they know it's unlikely anything will be done), which creates a toxic environment. It's hard to keep positive about your job when that's going on, even if you're doing well.

The office needs to be improved. There are two separate rooms, and often a bad smell because of a leak.  This separates and isolates some employees, which is detrimental at our young stage when we're trying to build a sustainable culture.  

The benefits and perks don't match up at all to other American tech companies in Dublin. This is to be expected at the stage of growth we are at but it's important to know this if you are applying that there are no free lunches (excuse the pun) or big budgets for team outings/activities! This will be there in the future I'd say."
empReview_9890530,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW9890530.htm,In at the Ground Level as an SDR in the EMEA office.,4.0," Sales Development Representativein Dublin, Dublin","Mar 12, 2016","It's so exciting to be part of Glassdoor at this early-stage. We literally had to ""build our own desks"" when we arrived as the first 10 people in the Dublin office. This phrase is central to Glassdoor's culture, signifying the GRIT and self-motivation you need to succeed at this stage of our growth as a company. 

SDR's, AE's and AM's all work in the same room so there is loads of collaboration and craic in the office. I learn something new every day; ranging from different sales techniques, ways to organise my day and how best to maximise my hours in work. I also laugh every day which I think is really important. There's a lovely mix of personalities in the office and we work well together. 

 As an SDR we learn everything about our sales process from the ground up and get a huge insight into the business - my previous experience was not in a tech environment so this is so valuable to me. 

We got stock options when joining the company which really makes me feel like I have a real investment in our success. It's great to know every deal that I help create contributes to the value of Glassdoor, which will benefit me and my colleagues in the future. 

We're looking to hire 100 people in the next 18 months so there is huge potential for growth here within the company. I'm already helping in the interview process with potential hires and I feel like my opinion is heard in the office. I'm really excited for things to come. 


There are no structure work hours and unlimited holidays which is fantastic. Even though this does generally fall into a 9-5 work day, it means that if you need to go to the bank or the dentist or take a day, there is no issue. It feels like we're being treated as adults - this is of course all dependent on performing well in relation to your targets - like any sales environment. 

Exciting times!","As SDR's we didn't get to go to San Fran for our yearly sales kick-off and training. This was disappointing because we feel like we missed out on a great opportunity to learn more about our company's culture and values. It's great motivation to get promoted to an AE or AM and go over for more training but it still felt like we weren't as valued as other employees who went over for training. 

We don't get all the perks of other tech companies in Dublin like free food, free gym or employer pension contributions. That's to be expected at our early stage and I'm sure that will all happen in the future. It's something to be aware of if you're coming from somewhere where everything is looked after for you. This office is scrappy and proud to be, it can be tough at times but that's what you're signing up for. 

We don't have employer contribution to pensions yet and have requested our phone expenses form (worth €40 a month) a few times but no word back from HR yet. I'm sure this is all part of the growing pains in such a fast-growing Company but it can still feel frustrating. 

Glassdoor's brand is still growing in the UK so a lot of our sales work is educating companies on the importance of getting engaged on their Glassdoor page. Again, this is expected to be the case in a growing company and it makes passing on good appointments to AE's even more satisfying."

We work with some of the largest and most exciting brands in the world, and we truly are providing a service that helps people make better decisions - Glassdoor's mission is strong and people believe in what we do, which comes across in how we do business with clients. International expansion is the biggest investment for the company, and being in EMEA is exciting. Senior leadership in the US is accessible and bright.","Very hierarchical structure in EMEA, especially in sales - there are Manager, Director, Sr Director and VP levels in place, yet the org is tiny in number of employees as of now. Several of these leadership hires were made externally, without the roles being posted internally to provide opportunity to grow despite this being a widely discussed pain point for employees. ~90% of the senior leadership team in EMEA is male (Director & above). Politics, lack of straightforward communication are becoming the norm, and we're too small for that.  After over 5 years of operating in the UK, Glassdoor continues not to have clear career progression in sales, assuming sales people want to be sales people for the rest of their lives. Lastly, there is no competitive maternity policy in place - 6 weeks partially paid leave followed by statutory pay. This does not attract strong female talent or incentivize it to stay."

empReview_17181099,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW17181099.htm,On the cusp of greatness...but don’t expect it to be handed to you. Work hard for it.,4.0," PR and Corporate Affairsin London, England","Oct 5, 2017","Depending on the role you have at Glassdoor, you can own, market, sell or develop a product which is not only highly influential but one that everyone wants to talk to you about. Pretty cool right? How often do you get to say you’re working for a business which is truly disrupting an industry? Well, Glassdoor is. And, at the very least, a job here will mean you immediately become an attractive candidate to all sorts of companies, from small start-ups right through to larger established businesses looking for someone with experience in a top-tier US-based tech company. 

After more than two years, I remain as committed as ever to the business because as well as always trying to be a loyal employee, I also believe and understand the mission. That’s of utmost importance. If you don’t believe in the mission here (or are not a good fit), you won’t last very long. This company is extremely agile and can make quick decisions if they notice something isn’t quite right. I like that.

Personally, I work with an exceptional bunch of individuals from my senior leaders based in our San Francisco HQ to my colleagues and friends here in the London office. Our CEO is seriously impressive, authentic and transparent, will give you face time if needed and makes an effort to get to know you. In my experience, the same can also be said for our senior leaders who now come to London/Dublin on a quarterly basis. 

Perform (or try new things) and you’ll be handsomely rewarded. Hide and you’ll get found out.","We’ve spoken and Glassdoor has listened. Both London and Dublin office spaces are being upgraded and the benefits structure is being looked at across both European teams to fit the needs of most. I think HR/senior leaders will be the first to admit that they dropped the ball in terms of setting up a competitive EMEA benefits package when we launched a few years ago, but it’s great that we’ve all had frank and open conversations about putting this right. This was a major con, but slowly we’re getting there. 

In terms of benefits, perks and office spaces, we are still some way off the likes of Facebook, LinkedIn, Expedia, AirBnB, Uber et al. And that’s okay, because we are just not there yet as a business. But, if that’s what you’re after/expecting, simply don’t apply and come back in five years. Our founders also started Expedia, so they know what they need to do to get to that level."

We work with the best brands in the world and we've been growing rapidly which means that no two days are the same on the job, regardless of which team you sit on - it's exciting to be part of that growth.  The organization is fairly flat and the executive team in the US is welcoming of feedback, and over the past few months has been communicating with more transparency with the EMEA group which has been well received - we're getting new offices in EMEA that are better aligned to the type of company Glassdoor is, and that's exciting.","There are cons that are  associated with the growing pains of being a start up and they're not negatives as such  but to someone coming from a larger organization those might be challenging - for example, working at Glassdoor EMEA is a demanding job and it is not your typical 9-5. It also requires that you roll up your sleeves and pitch in where help is needed, even if it's not in your direct area of expertise (that means helping with external events, organizing team events to build culture and morale, etc).  If you're not prepared to do that, this is not the place for you, at least at this stage of Glassdoor's growth. 
Glassdoor reacts very slowly to feedback - it reacts, which is appreciated, but it often takes months (and in some cases years) of mentioning certain challenges in order for senior management in the US to take action. We are still small enough - let's not wait until things get too dire.
Then there are cons that in my opinion are preventing strong talent from staying and growing and they are the real challenges of Glassdoor EMEA - there are almost no opportunities for career progression (unless, in my opinion, you are an SDR and move into a sales / account management role) and it is a topic that does not get addressed well enough, especially for a company with the mission of Glassdoor.  It is a topic that many people discuss amongst themselves and there is a general feeling of not being able to progress, but that management is vague about."

What I enjoy most about the Dublin Office are the inspirational people I work with every day, who believe in Glassdoor and our mission to help employers hire informed candidates at scale.

We genuinely enjoy spending time together both in and outside of our temporary home in Regus; whether that's going for a run at lunchtime or enjoying a couple of pints in the local pub, where we had a great evening with our CEO, Robert, and his wife when they visited the office a few months back.  As pioneers in Dublin, we have the honour of building our flavour of Glassdoor's culture, which is unique to Dublin and it's amazing to see it evolve and grow as we do.

There is a world of potential for Glassdoor in EMEA; don't be naive, it takes hard work and determination - long hours and flexibility and that is not for everyone, and that's ok. Every day I am challenged to find a new way to move forward, find a solution to a new problem that I haven't met before and that's part of the reason I joined.

You need to hold yourself accountable, no one is going to do it for you and it's up to you to find your way to make yourself successful. No one on the team should fear failure, if something goes wrong we share what happened, discuss what we learned and how we will avoid repeating the same mistakes as we move forward.

We are on the crest of the wave in EMEA and I am excited to see what the next 6-12 months will bring for Glassdoor Dublin.","Working for Glassdoor, I understand how powerful reviews are, and my intention is to collaborate on how we can make Glassdoor Dublin even better... 
As a remote office finding our own way, we have a host of challenges specific to Dublin; from IT and facilities to consistent processes and structure which can take its toll on team morale over time. It can sometimes be frustrating when there is a lack of guidance and it feels like we are battling to catch up as opposed to getting ahead of where we should be as the great company that we are.

I am confident that we will get there, as a team... it's what we pride ourselves on as a company, our grit and determination; and we need to see more inclusivity and autonomy to enable our shared success in EMEA."
empReview_19258215,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW19258215.htm,"The People, The Growth, The Experience",4.0," Senior Marketing Managerin Dublin, Dublin","Feb 15, 2018","Growth: Glassdoor has experienced tremendous growth since I started with the company in 2013. It has been a true privilege to be a part of the growth and maturity of this company and I have been given so many incredible opportunities to further myself as a marketer and as a person. Having the opportunity to gain global b2b marketing experience is invaluable. 

Momentum: I think we have really found our stride in the Dublin office. Things are falling in to place and we are starting to gain momentum. Admittedly, it was a tough transition breaking in to a new market without a playbook and we lacked a few key players to help lead the way but that was all part of the thrill and excitement for me. We had/still have the freedom to try creative campaigns/tactics to find out what exactly works for EMEA. 

People: The people make this office. Having moved to Dublin only knowing a handful of people, my co-workers have become some of my best friends and mentors. I really enjoy and admire the people in both the Dublin and London offices and we all generally share the same desire to win. We work hard and still find time to enjoy each other’s company.","Clarity around the future of this market: This has always been something I have struggled with but that’s part of being a global company. We didn’t have a dedicated person/people that were able to give insight in the long term plan for EMEA. With the recent addition of a few key roles, and dedicated exec buy in, I feel extremely hopeful for the future of Glassdoor in EMEA. 

Resources: This is not necessarily a con but in this office you have to be scrappy. You may not have the immediate resources you need at your fingertips so it’s up to you to go get them. That’s just how it is at a startup within a startup. It may fall on you to reach out to our U.S. counterparts to get access to resources you need and that’s okay."
empReview_22002673,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW22002673.htm,The future's ours,4.0," Sales Managerin London, England","Aug 16, 2018","I’ve been at Glassdoor London from the very scrappy and gritty beginning. I love that the scrappy and gritty culture remains a key component of our identity in the London office. We’re a “small” group of ~20 which for some of us seems like a HUGE group. That said, the size of the group fosters a sense of family and togetherness across teams and functions. Needless to say there’s banter, laughs, singing and a celebration of our individual differences, quirks and the diversity of the very multinational group.

You can generally twist someone’s arm to go for a cheeky beverage or few at one of the plethora of watering holes in the local area. Our shiny new office is perfectly located for after work cheekies and offers up endless options for lunch on the Southbank, Borough Market and Flat Iron Square to name but a few. Summer drinks on the Southbank have been quite the treat these past few weeks.

The outlook for the business is very bright especially since the Recruit acquisition was confirmed. International was already slated to be the focus for this and future years so the news of the acquisition fills us with even more excitement for what’s to come particularly for us in the international markets. Accelerated growth and even more opportunity is clearly on the horizon which makes us an even more attractive “startup” for talent with a desire to make a noticeable impact on a technology company on the upward trajectory of accelerated growth.","There’s a lot of change in a very short space of time which can be overwhelming and is exacerbated by the pace at which we are growing and evolving in Europe. This is both a pro and a con dependent on your perspective. In this environment some will flourish and some will not but it is definitely a period where you need to buckle up and hold on tightly because we’re going places very fast!! 

We are still lacking in some support functions but steps have been taken to address challenges around local IT, HR, Benefits etc."

empReview_14701751,/Reviews/Employee-Review-Glassdoor-RVW14701751.htm,Unfulfilling sweatshop,1.0," Account Executivein Dublin, Dublin","Apr 19, 2017","Glassdoor has attracted some genuinely cool people and the idea of working for a ""Startup"" in a new market sounded appealing.","Where to start... If you are a seasoned sales pro, this is not the place for you. Many have come and many have gone. 

Your CV will get you the interview, your performance in the interview will get you the job and then prepare to forget everything that has made you successful and exist in a world of Sandler and scripted sales, asking nothing but a series of questions to the point where you are making the person on the other end of the phone uncomfortable. You hate when it's being done to you and now you're doing it to others, with your manager listening in! 

You will be assigned a book of 1500 accounts but expect them to be blasted by hundreds of templated emails by the SDR team and burnt. Aggressive American sales tactics are enforced and celebrated at Glassdoor with awards being handed out by the SDR Team Lead. But incredibly high activities have worked in the past for the US market, but we're not in the US market. You cannot conduct this way in Europe and not expect to be burnt.

You are not allowed to go after new business?! This was always the biggest mystery at Glassdoor, new business AE's can not go after new business. Non-stop expansion stories in the Irish media, with job announcement all across the country. 400 jobs in Dublin etc, and the company isn't a customer of Glassdoor, what will I do next?? Nothing, back to your book of accounts. With every major US tech company having an EMEA operation in Dublin, you would think that in a new market, this would be the lowest hanging fruit for the Dublin and London office. But no, when the topic is raised with management the response is ""you have 1500 accounts you should be focussing on."" Glassdoor hasn't figured out how to approach MNC's from beyond the US. 

The sales strategy is inbound focused - Pump the marketing engine full of cash and measure the outcome - organic traffic to free profiles. SDR receive inbounds and are not expected to qualify the lead. They are expected to uncover a Need before passing it to the AE. Again, another big mystery at Glassdoor, why is the success of the SDR and marketing team being inflated?? It makes no sense, the business is hurting the business. You will be forced to work a worthless pipeline and forced to do the job of an SDR. And then you will be asked in 1:1's ""if you asked the correct questions"" or ""did we get enough pain"". AE's are treated like poor behaving volunteers. 

Selling the product is a cycle of rinse and repeat, the same series of questions, the same presentations, dressed up to uncover an incredible amount of pain and presenting on what is essentially a coat of paint on a shop front. You will hate yourself after the first quarter. 

EMEA management are like fish out of water. Inexperienced, incredibly political and emotional. In place to enforce Sandler and ""learnings"",  through call breakdowns, 1:1's and team meetings. Weekly meetings sometimes hit 7 hours per week! Madness. Glassdoor love to enforce the methodology, over and over again. Friday afternoons meant it was time for the weekly, throw my colleague under a bus session, with 15 AE's and managers listening to one of your bad calls followed by a round the room critique. How embarrassing for those involved. Your manager will contact you through IM, Whatsapp and email at all hours, weekends and when you're on annual leave asking about your pipeline. There are no boundaries. The fall on the sword moment will be that they just want to make you successful and that's why they're reaching out. 

No perks to speak of. Typical in the tech industry due to the demands and nature of the business, good companies provide perks to ease stress. Glassdoor in the US provides perks and operate in a world where feedback and concerns are encouraged and acted on - They become better employers by doing this. In Dublin, there is one perk to speak of, a shared Nespresso machine in the shared kitchen of a serviced office. Completely unacceptable for a ""Startup"" who have been trading in Dublin for 14 months, carrying an EMEA HQ stamp. You will be told that business is creating a true startup environment which is something not everybody gets's to experience, (so count yourselves lucky?!). Obviously a complete cop-out. 

Apply for a role if you want to start a sales career in the tech industry. It would seem that previous experience isn't required and that the culture fit is what's most important. So if you can conform to the micromanagement and what I've outlined above, you'll do well.

What a truly disappointing experience."
